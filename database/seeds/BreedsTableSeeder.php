This is an active, tough dog that is agile enough to catch and dispatch rats and mice. Its gait is light, sound and confident. The affenpinscher has a monkeylike facial expression with long eyebrows and beard, which lends it an air of comic seriousness. This breed&#39;s rough coat is about 1 inch long on its body and somewhat longer on its head, neck, chest, stomach and legs. The coat type provided protection from vermin and harsh conditions.</p>  	<p>The affenpinscher lives up to its name &mdash; &quot;monkey terrier&quot; &mdash; in both looks and actions. A terrier at heart, it is busy, inquisitive, bold and stubborn, but it also loves to monkey around, being playful and mischievous. It tends to bark and even climb. Unlike most terriers, it is fairly good with other dogs and pets. This little dog is best with a family that likes entertainment and has a very good sense of humor.</p>  	',

The breed predates and is ancestral to the Griffon Bruxellois (Brussels Griffon) and Miniature Schnauzer. Dogs of the Affenpinscher type have been known since about 1600, but these were somewhat larger, about 12 to 13 inches, and came in colors of gray, fawn, black and tan and also red. White feet and chest were also common. The breed was created to be a ratter, working to remove rodents from kitchens, granaries, and stables. Banana Joe V Tani Kazari (AKA Joe), a five-year-old Affenpinscher, was named Best in Show at the 2013 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in New York City. This win is notable since it is the first time this breed has won Best in Show at Westminster.',

For centuries, the Afghan Hound was isolated in the mountains of Afghanistan, with locals reluctant to sell the breed to foreigners. Only in the 20th century was the breed finally brought to England, and later America, where it became a popular show dog and developed a somewhat glamorous reputation. In 2005, an Afghan Hound named Snuppy became the first cloned dog in history. A fictional Afghan Hound named What-A-Mess is the star of a popular series of children&rsquo;s books and cartoons.',

            'history' => 'The Airedale Terrier (also known as the &lsquo;Waterside Terrier&rsquo;, &lsquo;Bingley Terrier&rsquo;, or slightly less modestly the &lsquo;King of Terriers&rsquo;, for its height) comes from the Airedale valley in West Yorkshire, England. It was bred by crossing the Otterhound with the Black and Tan Terrier for increased ability in Water Rat hunting competitions on the Aire River. The result was a breed with great scenting and Otter hunting skills which could pursue and retrieve game from its den. It was later crossed with the Irish Terrier and Bull Terrier. The Airedale Terrier was first brought to North America in the 1880&rsquo;s. Champion Master Briar, born in 1897, is considered to be the patriarch of the breed. Airedale Terriers became renowned as messengers and search animals in World War I. President Roosevelt is quoted as saying &lsquo;An Airedale can do anything any other dog can do and then lick the other dog, if he has to.&rsquo; John Wayne&rsquo;s nickname, &lsquo;The Duke&rsquo;, was the name of his childhood Airedale Terrier, who accompanied him everywhere he went.',

The Akbash Dog represents a very rare and special mixture of Mastiff and gazehound characteristics that are important to maintain.

When judging this breed, preference should be given to Akbash Dogs who exhibit a perfect balance between the two types.  	Gender differences can be striking in this breed. Typically the dog is proportionately taller and heavier than the female. The bitch appears feminine in comparison to the dog. There is no difference in the ability of males or females to perform as guardians.</p>  	<p>The essential characteristics of the Akbash Dog are those that enable it to perform successfully as a livestock guardian. Akbash Dogs have the size, strength, and courage to challenge large predators and the speed and agility to chase fleet predators. Their temperament is calm, quiet, and steady.

The Akbash Dog is loyal, gentle, and quietly affectionate with its own family, including children and family pets, but remains aloof and suspicious toward strangers. It is also by nature watchful of other dogs and may, on its own territory, react aggressively to intruding dogs. Although independent in nature, the Akbash Dog responds well to basic training.

The first formal, written reference to the breed in Spain is in a chapter of the 14th century &quot;Book of the Hunt of Alfonso XI&quot; (Libro de la Monter&iacute;a de Alfonso XI) in which hunting dogs called Alani are described as having beautiful colours. Dogs of this type traveled with Spanish explorers and were used as war dogs (as was their role in Eurasia before migration) in the subjugation of Indian (Native American) peoples, as well as in the capturing of slaves. Large dogs that are similar in appearance and may share the history of the Alano Espa&ntilde;ol include the molossers of the Canary Islands such as the Dogo Canario (Perro de Presa Canario) as well as the Mast&iacute;n Espa&ntilde;ol (Spanish Mastiff). The Cimarron Uruguayo is a South American breed that also looks somewhat similar, and is descended from the dogs of the Spanish explorers and conquistadores. The breed is also sometimes called the Spanish Bulldog in English. English dog dealer Bill George imported a dog he called &quot;Big Headed Billy&quot; in 1840. He was used to increase size in English Bulldogs.',

This rare, bulldog-type guard dog descends form Buck Lane&#39;s dog named Otto. Lana Lou spoke of her granddaddy as always having had an &quot;Otto&quot; about the estate. One Otto was all one needed since these Bulldogs were capable of guard work and woods work. When PaPa Buck was killed by a train in 1943, his Otto proved his undying devotion by constant visitation and guard duty over the grave. Buck Lane&#39;s granddaughter, Lana Lou Lane continued the breeding program until she passed away in her sleep on July 20, 2001. Like the Plott Hound, this muscular breed is the creation of one American family, and its survival depends upon the nurturing it receives. Originating from English Bulldog stock, this dog&#39;s ancestors functioned as cattle and pig herders, but the Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog is bred solely for security and companionship. The Animal Research Foundation (ARF) was the first all-breed registry to ever recognize the late Ms. Lana Lou Lane&#39;s &quot;Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldogs&quot; in 1986. Ms. Lane was an ARF Certified Breeder up and until her passing in 2001, after which time her elderly mother, Mrs. Vivian Lane, took over her business affairs.

They have greater endurance in sled racing than Siberian Huskies do. Gentle and playful, this cheerful dog is very fond of his or her family. A puppy at heart, they are clever, sociable and loving, easy-going and docile, though they do generally have a lot of energy, especially as puppies. Good with children and friendly with strangers, they are not watchdogs, for they bark little and love everyone. Huskies are very intelligent and trainable, but they have a mind of their own and will only obey a command if they see the point and if you do not display leadership, they will not see the point in obeying you. Training takes patience, consistency and an understanding of the Arctic dog character.</p>  	',

They also range in size and build depending on the use of the dog, whether for racing or for working. A working sled dog may be 50 to 80 lbs and a racing sled dog may be 35 to 60 lbs for a male or female. The old-time village dogs were bred to imported Siberian dogs, and more recently to European dogs. Racing sled dogs vary greatly in type, and may contain purebred pointer or hound to the modern Eurohound, a sprint dog that is unmatched for winning sprint races and is a predominantly black-colored combination of husky and German Shorthaired Pointer. Alaskan huskies intended for distance racing will compete 50 to 1,000 miles, where as mid-distance dogs compete 20 to 250 miles. Many of them retain the much-sought-after thick coat, balanced bodies, and tough feet of other northern breeds. Alaskan Huskies with hound or pointer bloodlines may sometimes wear booties and coats during races due to shorter and thinner coat, and less hardy feet.',

They are extremely energetic and intelligent, and their northern heritage is evident in their appearance.

When dog fighting was prohibited in 1908, the breed was preserved and improved as a large Japanese breed. During World War II, the breed was nearly lost, and following the war, due to crossbreeding, the Akitas that remained were of three distinct types. Akitas of the Dewa lines, which had characteristics from Mastiff and German Shepherd crosses, were brought to the United States by members of the Military Forces. These dogs fascinated American dog fanciers and the breed rose quickly in popularity. Akitas in the United States developed as a type unique to this country and they are now quite different than the breed in its country of origin.',

The distinct American Hairless Terrier breed began in 1972 when one hairless puppy named Josephine appeared in a Rat Terrier litter in the state of Louisiana, United States. Owners Edwin and Willie Scott liked the dog&#39;s look and temperament, and upon maturity bred her hoping to reproduce the hairless quality. They were eventually successful; a litter produced in 1981 provided the foundation stock of the breed.

The American breed was reared largely for illegal dog fighting (the &lsquo;Pit&rsquo; in Pit Bull likely derives from fighting pits) in the United States and was recognized as a distinct breed in 1936. American Staffordshire Terriers became popular with ranchers and farmers for protection, companionship, and catching hogs and cattle. Despite its media reputation for ferociousness, the American Staffordshire Terrier is an affectionate dog which has risen to popularity as a pet. The American Staffordshire Terrier&rsquo;s natural aggression is directed toward other dogs, not humans, and even this can be overcome with training. They often serve as search dogs or police dogs.

Although it is not recognized as a breed, some &quot;lines&quot; have been bred together longer than some recognized modern breeds. The best way to visualize the American Staghound is to blend together the characteristics of the Scottish Deerhound with the Greyhound. This is a running dog with the physical characteristics that would be referred to as the Greyhound prototype. It has long legs, a deep chest and strong muscles. The Staghound has great visual acuity, and some have been bred for some scenting ability while on course. It can be found in any assortment of color or color patterns that can be found on the Greyhound and Scottish Deerhound. There are three coat types: the &quot;shag,&quot; which more closely resembles the Scottish Deerhound; the &quot;slick,&quot; which more closely resembles the Greyhound; and the &ldquo;broken,&rdquo; which is in between the two. The American Staghound has all of the physical and mental characteristics needed for running down its quarry. It is known for having speeds that approach that of a Greyhound, but unlike a Greyhound, some specimens have incredible endurance.</p>  	<p>American Staghounds are generally gentle, calm and affectionate with their family.&nbsp; Due to the American Staghound&#39;s hunting heritage, the breed usually does poorly as guard dogs as the American Staghound is seldom territorial.</p>  	',
                'history' => 'The American Staghound is primarily the result of Scottish Deerhound and Greyhound genetics of unknown genetic percentages. For the most part, the Staghound has been bred Staghound to Staghound since the 1800s, but excellent hunting first cross Greyhound / Deerhound dogs are still added to the breed. It is not the direct progeny of a pure Scottish Deerhound crossed with a pure Greyhound. When America was settled, the Greyhound, Scottish Deerhound, and possibly their crosses found their way to the New World. Coursing quarry was used for sport, food and fur. For the first time ever, the coyote was coursed with running dogs. Coursing dogs have been used for wolves in other countries as well as in America, but the coyote posed a new challenge. The coyote is faster than the wolf, and pound for pound fights as hard as a wolf. Over the course of settlement and westward expansion it was found that the cross between the very fast, fine-boned Greyhound with the more robust Scottish Deerhound gave a mighty fine coursing animal used for coyote in difficult terrain. The Scottish Deerhound also contributed his rough jacket and better scenting abilities. Staghound was bred to Staghound and was most often culled specifically for characteristics that favored the pursuit of coyote. A few hundred generations of this sort of breeding led to what many refer to as the epitome of coyote-coursing sighthounds. In essence, the American Staghound was born. General George A. Custer used the Staghound as part of his dog pack that he used to course on a variety of North American animals. The Staghound has always been in the hands of huntsmen, and without the right to pursue quarry with running dogs the Staghound will go extinct.',

The AWS is considered a rare breed.

There were, however, always breeders who appreciated the beauty of the white dogs and who continued to breed them.

Andalusians and mastiffs form the heart of the rehalas (teams of 20 to 24 hunting dogs) of central and southern parts of the Iberian Peninsula; medium and smaller dogs search out deer or wild boar, whilst the larger hounds are used for attacking the prey. One of the most typical functions of the large Andalusian hound was that of the so-called quitaor accompanying the Spanish greyhound colleras during hare hunting. The quitaor&lsquo;s job consisted primarily of flushing out the hares from their home or hiding place and killing them; then, together with the greyhounds, retrieving them for the owner. In Andalusian farmhouses the larger hounds were used as watchdogs, and the smaller hounds were used to kill rodents.</p>  	',

These dogs are similar to other Iberian breeds such as the Ibizan Hound, the Portuguese Podengo, the Podenco Canario and the Maneto. In the Iberian Peninsula there are cave paintings representing dogs with a strong resemblance to these races. Dogs very similar to these, including the Cirneco dell&#39;Etna and Pharaoh Hound, have been bred in much of the Mediterranean basin since ancient times. Despite the widespread belief that the podencos were introduced into Spain some 3,000 years ago by the Phoenicians, recent genetic studies have concluded that these dogs actually have a close genetic relationship with other European hunting dogs and are no more &quot;primitive&quot; than the others.',

It was also used as a draft dog, and general farm dog. The breed also was known for its affinity to both herd and guard with such devotion that they would give their life to protect their charge.

When the wide open plains of Australia were opened for grazing in the early 19th century, the cattle were so active and unruly that the established lines of European herders weren&rsquo;t up to the task. In 1840, a man named Thomas Hall crossed some blue merle Smooth Highland Collies with dingoes to create a breed known as the &lsquo;Hall&rsquo;s Heelers.&rsquo; These were crossed with the Bull Terrier in the 1870&rsquo;s, making the breed more aggressive, and later with the Dalmatian for increased &lsquo;carriage&rsquo; capability&mdash;the ability to run alongside horses. The Australian Cattle Dog&rsquo;s distinct appearance and highly capable herding skills gained it notoriety across Australia. It was later imported to America and recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1980. An Australian Cattle Dog named Bluey lived from 1910 to 1939, giving it the Guinness World Record for longest canine life span.',

It is believed that some Basque farmers brought ancestors of these dogs with them when they emigrated to Australia, then subsequently to the United States during the 1849 California gold rush. However, the breed as it is known today was developed in the American Southwest over the next few decades. The Australian dog was crossed with several breeds in an effort to produce an animal able to deal with the harsh temperatures and demands of the American West. Breeding during this period was mainly focused on ability&mdash;speed, agility, and endurance--rather than appearance, which delayed the Australian Shepherd&rsquo;s recognition as a breed. Australian Shepherds became popular pets after they were featured as rodeos performers in the 1950&rsquo;s, and later in Disney films such as &lsquo;Run Appaloosa Run&rsquo;. Australian Shepherds were recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1993.',

It is also said it was crossed with the Yorkshire Terrier to control the size. It is a typical terrier in character and temperament and an effective rodent killer and watchdog.

It is speculated that its long ears may stir up ground scent, and the wrinkles trap the scent around the face. The large muzzle gives ample room for the olfactory apparatus. Such room would not be available in a miniature dog; only a large dog with shortened legs can combine the short height with large muzzle size. The basset&#39;s movement is smooth and powerful; it tends to move with nose to the ground.</p>  	<p>The basset hound is among the most good-natured and easygoing of breeds. It is amiable with dogs, other pets and children, although children must be cautioned not to put strain on its back with their games. It is calm inside, but it needs regular exercise to keep fit. It prefers to investigate slowly, and loves to sniff and trail. It is a talented and determined tracker, not easily dissuaded from its course. Because of this, it may get on a trail and follow it until it becomes lost. It tends to be stubborn and slow-moving. It has a loud bay that it uses when excited on the trail.</p>  	',
            'history' => 'The Basset Hound (&lsquo;Basset&rsquo; derives from &lsquo;dwarf&rsquo;) was bred at St. Hubert&rsquo;s Abbey in medieval France to trail game. They were bred for sharp noses and short legs to be able to squeeze in under thick foliage, but were not meant to run at fast speeds, so as to prevent them from scaring game away or outrunning human companions. They were especially suited for rabbit hunting. Basset Hounds grew in popularity when Napoleon III kept a few as pets, and became known internationally during the 1863 Paris dog show. They were subsequently brought to America in the late 1800&rsquo;s. Today, Basset Hounds are a popular pet and remain admired pack hunters. Some American cities, such as Buffalo and New Orleans, have annual Basset Hound-focused festivals and competitions, even crowning King and Queen Bassets. Famous Basset Hounds include comic strip character Fred Basset and the logo for &lsquo;Hush Puppies&rsquo; brand shoes.',

The dog was developed because of affection for the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and the Beagle breeds; the breeders were looking for a healthy, energetic small dog with a less active scent drive than that of the Beagle. They are very popular in Australia due to their temperaments. The Beaglier typically has the shorter and more rounded muzzle of the Cavalier. Beagliers have variable coat colours and markings.',

            'history' => 'The Bearded Collie originated in Britain and is one of the country&#39;s oldest breeds. The foundation of the breed was started in 1514 when a Polish sea captain made a trade with a local Scottish shepherd. He traded three of his Polish Sheepdog (Polski Owczarek Nizinny; PON) for a ram and a ewe. The shepherd then bred these dogs with other herding and flock dogs such as the Old English Sheepdogs (bobtails) and the Komondor. The dogs were used as herding dogs for centuries in Scotland and became known as the &quot;Highland Collie,&quot; the &quot;Highland Sheepdog&quot; and the &quot;Hairy Moved Collie.&quot; They were excellent workers, herding sheep and cattle for local shepherds. The name &quot;Bearded&quot; comes from the long hairs that grow on the chin, making the dog look like he has a beard, and the name &quot;Collie,&quot; which is the Scottish word for herding dog. The Bearded Collie almost became extinct during the Second World War. In 1944 Mrs. G. O. Willison from Great Britain bred a pair of Bearded Collies, resurrecting the breed. In 1967 the first litter of Beardies was whelped in the USA. The breed was first recognized by the AKC in 1976. They are still to this day considered a rare breed. Some of the Beardie&#39;s talents are tracking, herding, agility, competitive obedience and performing tricks.',

Besides its role as a herding dog, this breed is also used to guard linen that is placed in fields to dry. In the First and Second World War, the Laekenois was used a messenger dog . The Laekenois is considered both the oldest and the most rare of the Belgian Shepherd Dogs. Until the advent of dog shows in the early 1900s, the four varieties were freely intermixed, in fact, there are only three genes (short/long coat, smooth/wire coat, fawn/black coat) that separate the varieties genetically. Purebred Laekenois occasionally give birth to smooth-coated puppies, which, depending on the pure-bred registry, can be registered as Malinois. The Laekenois is currently in the American Kennel Club&#39;s Miscellaneous Class and is assigned the Herding Group.',

Although the Berger Picard made an appearance at the first French dog show in 1863, the breed&rsquo;s rustic appearance did not lead to popularity as a show dog. The two World Wars nearly caused the extinction of the Berger Picard and it is still rare, even in France. The Berger Picard was recognized by the United Kennel Club on January 1, 1994.',

                'history' => 'The Bernese Mountain Dog, or Berner Sennenhund in his native Switzerland, was used as an all-around farm dog by Alpine herdsmen in the canton of Bern. The dogs drove cattle to pasture, pulled milk carts to the dairy, and acted as watchdogs on the farm. Generally, Berners hauled milk in pairs, so it was common to see two of them hooked to a cart. Berners are thought to have descended from mastiff-type dogs who came to Switzerland along with Roman armies some 2,000 years ago. There they interbred with local dogs and were developed to help with farm work. With industrialization, however, the dogs almost disappeared. The breed was revived in the early 20th century to become a companion dog, although many still carried out their traditional farm duties as well. The American Kennel Club recognized the Bernese Mountain Dog in 1937.',

The Barbet was cross bred with a small coated white breed to derive the Bichon. Bichons were classified under four categories: the Havanese, Bolognese, Maltaise, and Tenerife, from which the Bichon Frise ultimately descended. They were brought home from the Canary Islands by Italian sailors in the 1300&rsquo;s and became popular pets for the French and Italian upper class, including King Francis I. Bichon Frises sank in popularity through World War I to the point of nearly being lost, but survived via their popularity as tricksters, accompanying street minstrels. French breeders in the 1930&rsquo;s made an effort to revive the breed, which finally took off in popularity after being brought to America in the 1950&rsquo;s.',

In 1945, the Black and Tan Coonhound became the first Coonhound variety to be recognized by the American Kennel Club. The Redbone Coonhound and Plott Hound were later recognized in the AKC&rsquo;s Miscellaneous Class; other varieties are the Treeing Walker Coonhound, Bluetick Coonhound, and English Coonhound.

To put some perspective on it, these dogs have been around since man hunted with slingshots and lived in caves. They worked as hunting and guard dogs for the Vikings. The dogs were used as big and small game hunters, tracking animals such as moose, elk, bear, mountain lion, badger, lynx, wolf, reindeer and rabbit. The dogs would track the quarry and alert the hunter by barking, holding the animal at bay until the hunter arrived. Norwegian Elkhounds can smell game from over a mile away. The dogs tended to work better at night than in the daytime. The breed is also highly prized as a sled dog. In case of war, the Norwegian Defense Minister has the power to mobilize all privately owned Elkhounds. In more recent times, the friendly and reliable character of the Elkhound has helped win a place in many homes as a cherished family pet. The name &quot;Elkhound&quot; is a direct translation from its original Norwegian name &quot;Elghund,&quot; meaning &quot;moose dog.&quot; In Norwegian, &quot;elg&quot; means &quot;moose&quot; and &quot;hund&quot; means &quot;dog.&quot; Some of the Elkhound&#39;s talents include: hunting, tracking, herding, watchdog, guarding, sledding and agility. There is also a more popular standard gray Norwegian Elkhound that is recognized as a separate breed, but is almost identical in type except for color.',

The initial breeding was supervised by the military cynological school outside Moscow, and the dogs were based in their kennels named &ldquo;Red Star&rdquo;. The aim of the creators of the breed was the development of a large, brave, strong and manageable working dog with pronounced guarding instinct; a dog that could be useful for many services.

All Blue Lacys eyes are very bright and distinctive orange to yellow in color, which adds a unique touch to their appearance.</p>  	<p>Blue Lacy Dogs in general are intelligent, intense, active, and alert. Developed to be both hunting and herding dogs, they display great drive and determination to work with big game and control difficult livestock.

                'history' => 'The Lacy Dog or Blue Lacy Dog is a breed of working dog that originated in Texas in the mid-19th century. The Lacy was first recognized in 2001 by the Texas Senate. In Senate Resolution No. 436, the 77th Legislature honored the Lacy as &quot;a true Texas breed&quot;. In June 2005, Governor Rick Perry signed the legislation adopting the Blue Lacy as &quot;the official State Dog Breed of Texas&quot;. As expected, the vast majority of Lacy dogs are found in Texas. However, as the breed becomes more well recognized, there are breeding populations being established across the United States, Canada, and most recently in Europe.',

They have been also guarding Bohemian southwestern borders and homes in the area of the Chod region (around DomaÅ¾lice town). &quot;Chodov&eacute;&quot; (the Chods), the local people living there, had an exceptional permission to hold large dogs for this purpose. Alois Jir&aacute;sek, writing about a brave uprising of the local people, even assigned these dogs as a flag symbol of them. Though that is actually incorrect, the symbol became part of national knowledge due to drawings of a well known Czech painter Mikol&aacute;&scaron; Ale&scaron;. The symbol of the Chodsk&yacute; pes is still on Czech young scouts badges. As the breed of chodsk&yacute; pes is old, it is possibly also one of the predecessors to the German Shepherd. Chodsk&yacute; pes is known to have existed in the Czech lands as far back as the 14th century, and having been professionally bred as early as the 16th century, centuries before the Germans decided to try to make their own national breed. A modern breeding program for this dog was started in 1984 and there are now many breeders. About 3500 registered pups have been born since the program started (1984&ndash;2009). Therefore, there is no proof that they are related to German Shepherds.',

One of the people attending the services there, a Mr. Alexander L. White, took the dog home as a pet. The dog apparently displayed some hunting aptitude so Mr. White sent the dog to be trained by his hunting partner, Mr. L. Whitaker Boykin of the Boykin community just outside of Camden, South Carolina. With this training, the little stray developed into a superb turkey dog and waterfowl retriever. This dog, said to be a male, was the forerunner of all Boykin Spaniels in existence today. Early ancestors of the breed are thought to be the Chesapeake Bay Retriever, English Springer Spaniel, Cocker Spaniel and the American Water Spaniel. The Boykin Spaniel became fully recognized and registrable with the American Kennel Club in December 2009.',

It has pendulous upper lips and long ears that create a serious expression. It should be &quot;almost square&quot;, meaning that its height at the withers should be almost the same as the length of its body. It should not however be actually square as this would render its famous rear driving push off and front/rear extension to be compromised, thus losing much of its powerful grace. The tail can be docked, mostly due to the strong possibility of injury in rough/dense terrain when hunting, however there has been a sea-change in Italy, with some now working the breed with full tail.</p>  	<p>Braccos are very much a people-loving dog and thrive on human companionship, having a strong need to be close to their people. They are a particularly good family dog, and many have a strong love of children. They get along well with other dogs and pets, if trained to do so - it is, afterall, a hunting breed - and must be taught what to chase and what not to. They are very willing to please as long as they have decided that your idea is better than theirs. Obedience training is a must for a Bracco, and the more is asked of them, the better they do. Harsh reprimands do not work with this breed unless the reprimand is a fair one - and harshness must occasionally be used with some dogs to remind them who is actually in charge. Although not an aggressive breed, many Braccos will alert if there is a reason, and some will bark or growl if there&#39;s a good reason. The breed loves to hunt, and they excel at it - in fact, a non-hunting Bracco is not a happy Bracco, and will act out in various other ways. Hunting without a gun (as in NAVHDA - this group does not even allow a handler to carry a gun during trials) is an area in which the Bracco can excel and this can be a great opportunity for training the dog to connect with the owner. They are an active breed, but require more mental exercise than physical exercise to keep them happy. A Bracco owner can teach games like hide-and-seek (an object or person) which fits into the breed&#39;s original and current usage, and keeps them mentally active.</p>  	',

The Briard is primarily a flock guard and herding dog, which is what it&#39;s main purpose was up until World War I. The Briard&#39;s use in World War I brought the breed nearly to extinction. They were utilized for many tasks such as running messages, delivering food and ammunition to the front lines, locating wounded soldiers, detecting mines and picking up trails. The Briard developed popularity in 1863 after the Paris dog show. The Briard became fully recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1906. This breed is still utilized as a flock guard, however, it has also taken on work with the military, police and search and rescue. The Briard may be an excellent working dog, but they are still considered wonderful family companions.',

The Belgian Griffon has a longer coat than the Brussels Griffon and the Petit Brabancon has a shorter smooth coat. The Brussels Griffon was very popular in the 17th century with cab drivers that utilized them in their stables to rid them of vermin. Several other breeds may have contributed to the Brussels Griffon that you see today, such as the Affenpinscher, English Toy Spaniel, Belgian street dog, Yorkshire Terrier and Irish Terriers. The Brussels Griffon, while a fine companion, is not a terribly popular breed. It has gained some popularity after the appearance of a Brussels Griffon in the film &ldquo;As Good As It Gets&rdquo;, however, it remains a rare breed.

The Karakachan was officially approved as a Bulgarian old native breed in 2005. The Karakachan dog may be a descendant of ancient Balkan domestic dogs, possibly since the time of the Thracians. In ancient Thracian treasures, figures were found of big, longhaired guardian dogs with curled tails.

Due to their conservative stock-breeding traditions, they managed to preserve some of the oldest breeds of domestic animals in Europe &ndash; the Karakachan sheep, the Karakachan horse, and, of course, the Karakachan dog. It is with this name that the Karakachan dog appears in the works of some of the classics of Bulgarian literature, namely Yordan Yovkov, Georgi Raitchev and Yordan Radichkov. In 1938 H. B. Peters wrote about it in the German cynologycal magazine.

Some believe English Pointer was used instead of German Shorthaired Pointer and Saluki (hence the name Arab) instead of Greyhound. Some lines include 12.5% Bloodhound blood to add stamina and tracking ability, this strain is often called the Paulsen Bull Arab after Peter Paulsen its creator.

After dog fighting was abolished, Bull Terriers were bred with the Dalmatian to produce a white colored strain, then again with the Staffordshire Bull Terrier to reintroduce color. Both the white and colored types increased in popularity as pets, and both strains remain today.

The Bulldog was a little too ferocious and not large enough for the task. This cross resulted in the development of a breed that was totally utilitarian.

They were utilized by farmers to catch and kill mice, squirrels and other rodents. The Cairn Terrier was originally known as the Short-haired Skye Terrier until they were brought to the United Kingdom&#39;s dog show in 1909. Sky Terrier breeders did not take well to the name and a compromise was reached with the name Cairn Terrier. The Cairn Terrier was given his new name for the frequent trapping of fox and badger in the very common cairns(man made piles of rock used for marking locations) all over Scotland.

The breed, if treated with kindness and respect, can be exceptionally loyal. They are not very friendly, and do not like to be touched by strangers. However, a Caravan should never be aggressive, as this sort of temperament is not ideal for a hunting dog, which must tolerate other dogs and human beings, especially when they are not intruding on his territory. It makes a reasonable watch dog, and can protect that which he holds dear, should the need arise. He should always be treated in a kind, consistent, fair, and respectful manner, otherwise he may develop a nervous or vicious nature&mdash;either of which are difficult to live with.</p>  	',

The breed is popular in and around Mudhol Taluk of Karnataka and thus the breed got the name as Mudhol hound. Shrimant Rajesaheb Malojirao Ghorpade of Mudhol (1884-1937) of the Mudhol State is credited with reviving the Mudhol hound. He noticed local tribal people called Beda using these hounds for hunting. Using selective breeding, he was able to restore the royal Mudhol hound. On a visit to England in the early 1900s, the Maharaja of Mudhol State presented King George V a pair of hounds, which popularized the Mudhol hound breed.',

Whatever the case may be, the Cardigan and the Pembroke Welsh Corgis were interbred and considered the same breed up until 1934 when a show judge thought they were too different and separated them into two different breeds. After they were separated the Pembroke gained in popularity and is to this day more popular than the Cardigan. The name &quot;corgi&quot; is specific to that type of dog breed in Cymreig (Welsh). Dog in Cymreig (Welsh) is &#39;Ci&#39; or if it is softly mutated &#39;Gi,&#39; hence Corgi. The Pembroke was actually recognized by the AKC a year before the Cardigan. The Cardigan was recognized in 1935 and the Pembroke in 1934. Corgis were used as cattle drivers, vermin hunters and farm guards. They drove cattle by barking and nipping at the cattle&#39;s heels rather than just herding them. The dog&#39;s low stature helped him roll out of the way of kicking cows.',

The distinctive features of the breed are those that confer survival advantages under free-living conditions in the tall grassland savannah and bottomland swamp forest habitats of the South, southeastern, and Southwestern United States. The dog typically has a medium-length straight back, with a distinctive waist which sets off a deep brisket from a highly tucked-up loin. The tail is distinctive in both its fish-hook-like configuration and its variable carriage, depending on mood. The medium to large, usually upright ears and long, graceful neck are also distinctive and suggest the appearance of a small, versatile and resourceful predator, well adapted to surviving on its own in a natural habitat. In ideal conditions, a Carolina Dog should appear thin and tight. It is not inappropriate, for example, for the ribs to show slightly as in a well-conditioned racing sighthound. Individuals that are greatly overweight should be severely penalized. The dog is to be shown in a natural condition, with little or no evidence of grooming or scissoring. Whiskers are not to be removed.</p>  	<p>Carolina Dogs are natural runners. They have excellent noses that help them hunt wild animals, when in the wild. When kept as pets, the breed requires moderate exercise and sufficient space. They need to be exposed to a lot of social activity from a young age. Once they are trained enough, they are said to make excellent family dogs.</p>  	',

Not all of these designer hybrid dogs being bred are 50% purebred to 50% purebred. It is very common for breeders to breed multi-generation crosses. The Catahoula Bulldog has tight skin and a very short, smooth coat. In most cases the Catahoula does not have an undercoat but may develop one if it is living in a seasonal or colder climate. Ears come in rose type or button over and are sometimes cropped for a noble look. Eye color can come in brown, ice blue, gold, emerald green or a combination of all of these.

While the Catahoula Leopard Dog was very skilled at luring a hog to a pen then escaping over the back of the pen, it was not large or rugged enough by itself to catch a hog. The American Bulldog had the extra size, weight, and strong jaw as well as being an excellent catch dog, while the Catahoula Leopard had the intelligence, speed, endurance and the instincts of hunting and herding. Catahoula bulldogs are one example among many of niche working crossbreeds (as opposed to &quot;designer dogs&quot; crossbred for appearance) that are in development. Others (often with pseudo-archaic names) have been dubbed the Olde English Bulldogge (recognized as a breed by UKC) and Perro de Presa Mallorquin (&quot;saved&quot; from extinction by extensive crossbreeding), among more experimental crosses.',

The Catahoula was named after a Parish in northeastern Louisiana and after the mottled spots on its coat. At one time this breed was used to round up feral pigs and cattle&mdash;livestock that had escaped, and was living in woods and swamps. It involved team effort that is highly coordinated and organized, fast paced, dangerous and a marvel to watch. The ideal dog team usually numbers three, and they must work together. Otherwise, one pig can kill all three in a matter of minutes. Each dog has to be aware of what the pig and the other two dogs are doing and react accordingly. Hunters sometimes used the Catahoula to trail and tree raccoons, but this dominant breed is more at home acting the thug with obstinate boars. This dog is used particularly on the difficult task of driving and rounding hogs and unruly cattle.',

Although its first official Show-Ring appearance outside the Caucasus was in the 1930s in Germany, the Caucasian Mountain Dog has existed since ancient times, like many Eastern Molossers. They served shepherds in the Caucasus mountains as guard dogs, defending sheep from predators, mainly wolves, jackals and bears. They are still successfully served in this job, especially in Georgia, and the shepherds life is impossible without these dogs. The show dogs, also known as Caucasian Ovcharka, were created by the USSR during the 1900s using the dogs taken mainly from Georgia. Now, Caucasian shepherd dog is a fully standardized breed recognized by the major kennel organizations, including FCI, AKC and UKC.',

Mr. Horak&#39;s goal was to breed a dog that was narrow enough to successfully get down into the dens and burrows to hunt rats and fox. By the 1980s breeders felt the Cesky Terrier no longer looked like the dogs Mr. Horak bred, so they crossed them yet again with Sealyham Terriers. The breed was first imported to the USA in 1987 and to this day is quite rare. By 1993 there were said to be only about 150 Cesky Terriers in the USA. The breed may be shown at the National Cesky Terrier Club, rare breed shows, state kennel clubs and at some FCI and UKC shows. The Cesky Terrier is a good hunter, tracker, watch and guard dog.',

General sizes of a chizer range between 6-14 inches in height and approximately 4-15-lbs in weight. The chizer is a small breed dog, and works great in smaller areas, such as apartments, condos, and townhomes. The chizer comes in a typical variety of colours, usually grey, black, brown or white. This breed has a smooth, short haired coat that needs constant grooming, trimming around the eyes, ears and nose. They are usually low to average shedding dogs, and typically most groomers leave their facial hair to mimic a schnauzer beard. The ears of a chizer are medium in length and can stand erect when at attention, and their tail is usually docked. The chizer can have either an apple shaped head, or round head, with either a long or short snout, giving it either the appearance of a Chihuahua or Miniature Schnauzer. The body of the chizer is generally long and lean, with slender legs, and a square, robust back end. This back end tends to make the dog sturdier, and gives them surprising jumping abilities to reach great heights.',

Cockapoos are active, and thrive when they receive regular exercise. Cockapoos can be very agile, excelling at &quot;retrieve&quot; games and enjoying activities such as swimming. Cockapoos are frequently very needy dogs and as such are not suitable to be left alone for long periods as they frequently suffer from separation distress or anxiety. The Cockapoo is a cross-breed, not a purebred, and does not &quot;breed true.&quot; In breeders&#39; terms, &quot;breeding true&quot; means that the pups will have consistently predictable characteristics.

Tulear was once a popular port of merchant ships sailing the Indian Ocean, and it is believed that around the 15th or 16th century, European merchants introduced various Bichon-type companion dogs to Madagascar. It is probable that the breed evolved from the interbreeding of those Bichon strains. It is presumed that because of their beauty and affectionate personality, these dogs were offered to the King and Malagasy nobles. In the 17th century, the Coton de Tulear was adopted by the ruling &quot;Merina&quot; tribal monarchy, and it was forbidden that anyone other than royalty own the breed. Thus became the breed&#39;s prevalent title of &quot;Royal Dog of Madagascar.&quot; The Coton de Tulear was officially recognized by the AKC in 2014.',

The Curly-Coated Retriever is an excellent hunting companion and gun dog, waterfowl retriever and upland game hunter, with a gentle mouth. They were often used to hunt duck and quail. The breed is pretty rare inside the USA but is more popular in Australia and New Zealand. The first exports to America were in 1907. The Curly-Coated Retriever was recognized by the AKC in 1924.

The breed was popular among the gypsies and was used by farmers to kill vermin. With its short legs it was able to go to ground hunting badgers and otter. In 1814 Sir Walter Scott wrote about the breed in his famous novel &quot;Guy Mannering.&quot; In the book there was a character named Dandie Dinmont, and that is where the breed got its name. It was recognized by the AKC in 1886. Some of the Dandie Dinmont&#39;s talents are vermin catcher, hunting rabbit, otter, badger, martens, weasels and skunks.',

Dobermann was a tax collector who sought to breed an alert guard dog for personal protection. Within a decade, a breed similar to the modern Doberman Pinscher had been created, popularized, and imported to America. In America, it became a popular guard and police dog, and later a well-admired show dog. By the late 1970&rsquo;s, the Doberman Pinscher was the second most popular breed in America. Today, it serves mostly as a pet. Famous Doberman Pinschers include Zeus and Apollo, &lsquo;the lads&rsquo; from &lsquo;Magnum, P.I.&rsquo;. Doberman Pinschers are the official combat dog of the U.S. Marines.',

Raymond Triquet and his French Dogue de Bordeaux Club saved the breed. The Dogue de Bordeaux is now thoroughly established in France and gaining popularity in other countries.

It has short fur, and is of any color with white markings (but not all white, which has been linked to deafness.) The breed has the typical drop (hanging) ears of a hound, and a long tail. The maximum height of a Drever is 38 cm (15 ins) at the withers, which is about 15 cm (approx. 6 ins) shorter than a long legged hunting hound with the same size body. The Westphalian Dachsbracke is about 2 cm (less than an inch) shorter than the Drever.</p>  	<p>Alert, calm, friendly and even, the Drever is known for the ongoing slight wag of his tail. The Drever often wants to continue working long after its human companion has satisfied his own hunting instinct. It has a first-class nose and is a powerful tracker. Because of its short legs, it is slower than other hounds. This makes it ideal for maneuvering game toward the hunter&#39;s gun. The Drever is a steady worker that hunts hare, fox, and occasionally deer; but this dog has the courage to pit himself against even a wild boar. In such cases, he circles and dodges the prey, warning the hunter by barking furiously. The Drever has an excellent nose and a musical voice which is much larger than his size would seem to warrant. The Drever was bred to be tenacious on the hunt and therefore it is very important that the owners of this breed are just as stern when dealing with him in order to show him where his place is among his human pack. Owners who are determined and consistent with the rules, displaying a natural firm but not harsh authority over the dog will bring out the best in this breed. Passive owners will find the dog to become stubborn and headstrong. Drevers that lack in mental and physical exercise and/or leadership will develop quirks in their temperament. Socialize this dog well.</p>  	',

The American English Coonhound was developed from the &ldquo;Virginia Hounds&rdquo; when men such as the first president of the United States, George Washington, set out to create a hound that was better suited to the rougher terrain. The breed was used for all variations of hunting, including treeing, and were regularly utilized to hunt raccoon and American Red Fox.

Used in packs to chase fox with hunters on horseback, the Foxhound has impressive stamina and a good nose. He can run steadily for hours at a time. Some of the English Foxhound&#39;s talents are hunting, tracking, watchdog and agility. The English Foxhound was recognized by the AKC in 1909.

            'history' => 'The Mastiff (also known as the &lsquo;English Mastiff&rsquo;) is a British breed which descended from the Alaunt and other Molossers several thousand years ago. &lsquo;Mastiff&rsquo; likely derives from the Anglo-Saxon word &lsquo;masty&rsquo;, meaning &lsquo;powerful&rsquo;. The Mastiff&rsquo;s ancient origins are with the Molossians, an early Hellenic tribe known for its powerful guard dogs. In Roman times, the Mastiff was employed as a war dog and fighter, pit in the Arena against gladiators, bears, and even elephants. By the Middle Ages, the Mastiff was a popular guard dog and hunter. Unfortunately, it was still forced to fight, matched up against bears, bulls, and lions in popular gambling dens. Many Mastiffs today descend from the Lyme Hall Mastiffs, a line beginning with Sir Peers Legh&rsquo;s Mastiff, who protected him after he was wounded at the battle of Agincourt in 1415 (a stained glass window in Lyme Hall depicts Sir Legh and his Mastiff to this day). The Mastiff may have arrived in America on the Mayflower; it had certainly arrived by the 1800&rsquo;s. Mastiffs decreased in popularity in England after bull-baiting, bear-baiting, and lion-baiting were outlawed, but grew in popularity in the U.S throughout the twentieth century, remaining a popular pet and guardian today. The charming character of the Mastiff has helped it find its way into popular culture. Famous fictional Mastiffs include &lsquo;Hercules&rsquo; from &lsquo;The Sandlot&rsquo; and &lsquo;Kazak&rsquo; from Kurt Vonnegut&#39;s &lsquo;The Sirens of Titan&rsquo;.',

The name derived from the way the dog stands motionless when he spots his game as if he is pointing right at it. Before hunting with guns was popular, Pointers were used to find hare for the Greyhound to hunt. By the early 1700s the Pointer became very popular among hunters. Excellent at catching a scent and pointing the hunter in the right direction, the dogs are very quick and can cover a lot of ground in a short amount of time and are often used to flush out birds. They are not water dogs nor are they expected to retrieve the kill. The dogs work great in warm weather but do not do well when it is very cold. The English Pointer often wins Pointing Field Trials over all other pointing breeds. The Pointer was first recognized by the AKC in 1884.',

A. Harrisson in 1825. For the next 50 years, Laverack bred a line of setters famous for their hunting qualities and beauty. During the latter half of the 19th Century, R.L Purcell Llewellin acquired dogs from Laverack and made selective crosses with a focus on hunting that resulted in a unique strain of dogs.

English Shepherds usually have tails and a less rounded head than many Aussies. English Shepherds are never merle as Aussies frequently are. They are generally not square in body like an Aussie. English Shepherds tend to be larger than Border Collies but are most readily distinguished from Border Collies by their very different upright, loose-eyed herding style. The coat is medium length and can be straight, wavy, or curly. There is frequently feathering on the legs and tail, as well as on the ear. As a working dog, the coat should be easy to keep, requiring very little grooming. Dirt tends to just fall away. English shepherds tend to shed quite a lot and fur may be found on and under furniture, clothes, and carpeting. The primary coat colors are: sable and white (clear and shaded), tricolor, black and white, and black and tan. Other variations such as solid dogs of any color, piebalds, and red nosed tricolors and sables also exist but are not common.</p>  	<p>The English Shepherd temperament is the defining characteristic of the breed, with high intelligence and often a unique type of kindness for those in his home, both animals and people. The English Shepherd is often an independent worker. English Shepherds are adaptable and learn routines quickly. Some can be watchful of strangers and are more one-person dogs. However, once he accepts people or children or stock as his own, there are few better caretakers than an English Shepherd. The English Shepherd frequently exhibits an independent, bossy or &quot;enforcer of the rules&quot; streak in his temperament. If the dog&#39;s desire to enforce order is not channeled and directed to a suitable end by a strong, confident leader, he may exhibit many undesirable behaviors. Nevertheless, English shepherds can thrive as companion dogs in environments that provide sufficient mental and physical stimulation.</p>  	',

Romans used these dogs to herd the livestock brought along to feed the troops. As the livestock was depleted, surplus dogs were left along the way, and were used by local natives and interbred with existing types of dogs with similar herding talents to intensify those instincts. The English Shepherd was brought to the American colonies by some of the first settlers and followed the development of the United States from east to west. This multi-purpose breed was highly prized as it was used to herd valuable livestock and to protect the isolated homesteads. The United Kennel Club is the original registrar of the English Shepherd and has recognized them since 1927.',

It comes in different colors: fawn, red, wolf-grey, solid black, and black and tan. All color combinations are allowed, except for pure white, white patches, and liver color. F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) standards call for the Eurasier to have a thick undercoat and medium-long, loosely lying guard hair all over the body, with a short coat on the muzzle, face, ears, and front legs. The tail and the back of the front legs (feathers) and hind legs (breeches) should be covered with long hair. The coat on the Eurasier&#39;s neck should be slightly longer than on the body, but not forming a mane. The breed may have a pink, blue-black or spotted tongue.</p>  	<p>Eurasiers are calm, even-tempered dogs. They are watchful and alert, yet reserved towards strangers without being timid or aggressive. Eurasiers form a strong link to their families. For the full development of these qualities, the Eurasier needs constant close contact with its family, combined with understanding, yet consistent, training. They are extremely sensitive to harsh words or discipline and respond best to soft reprimand. The Eurasier is a combination of the best qualities of the Chow Chow, the Keeshond, and the Samoyed (dog), resulting in a dignified, intelligent breed. Eurasiers were bred as companion dogs; as such they do poorly in a kennel environment such as those commonly used for institutionally trained service dogs, nor are they well suited for the social stresses of working as a sled or guard dog. Training should always be done through family members, not through strangers or handlers. Eurasiers should never be restricted to only a yard, kennel, crate, or chained up. They would pine and become depressed. Within these limitations, Eurasiers can work very well as therapy dogs. This breed enjoys all kinds of activities, especially if the activities involve their family. Eurasiers are calm and quiet indoors, outdoors they are lively and enjoy action. Eurasiers rarely bark but if they do, they usually have a good reason.</p>  	',
            'history' => '&nbsp;The Eurasier was developed in the &#39;60s to be a gentle family dog and protector. German breeder Julius Wipfel began by crossing Chow Chows with Wolfspitzes (which in some countries are considered the same breed as the Keeshond). One Samoyed male also contributed to the new breed&rsquo;s bloodlines. Originally called the Wolf Chow, the dogs were recognized in 1973 by the Federation Cynologique Internationale and given the name Eurasier to symbolize their combined European and Asian heritage. The dogs are popular in Germany and Switzerland but are still little known in the United States. The breed was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1996 under the name Eurasian. The UKC categorizes it as a Northern breed, the FCI consider it a Spitz or Primitive type.',

During the 1800s the Field Spaniel was being bred with a greatly exaggerated length and weight. Almost a hundred years later in the 1920s, the standard returned to a moderate length and weight. Although it is a fine bird dog with a great, mild disposition, the breed remains rare to this day, most likely due to the extreme popularity of the Cocker Spaniel. The Field Spaniel was recognized by the AKC in 1894. Some of the Field Spaniel&#39;s talents are tracking, hunting, retrieving and watchdog.',

The dedication and obedience of the Fila Brasileiro has found its way into Brazilian saying &quot;As faithful as a Fila&quot;. The Fila Brasileiro temperament is what characterizes the dog. The Portuguese word for their temperament is Ojeriza, which directly translated into English means dislike and distrust. The socialization period (about the first year with the first 6-8 months being the most important) of the dog&#39;s life is crucial to the temperament of the individual dog. If the pup is exposed to a lot of people in a positive manner (known as &#39;socializing&#39;), the pup (keeping in mind the dog&#39;s natural protective instincts) can be encouraged to behave in a calm manner in public, but emphasis should be placed on the fact that socialization is done differently from other breeds. Despite extensive socialization, the fila is instinctively protective and will naturally guard and protect its owner, their family members and the family pets; this is not something that needs to be trained, it is an innate trait. Strangers should not be left unattended with a Fila and, like all other guardian breeds, it may not be the best choice for those who have frequent visitors to their homes.

Eventually, these herding Spitz type dogs developed into three breeds, the Swedish Lapphund, the Lapponian Herder, and the Finnish Lapphund.

They were used to hunt small game. When the dog would find their pray they would alert the hunter with their distinctive yodel type, ringing bark, pointing with their head in the direction the animal was in. The breed is more popular in Scandinavian countries and less popular in the USA, most likely due to their reputation of using their bark to alert their masters.

The Flat-Coats became very popular until the beginning of the World War when their numbers dwindled and their popularity never reached those high numbers again.

They have a superior sense of smell, are excellent swimmers, and are able to work well in marshy areas. They are wonderful bird dogs, doing very well retrieving on plains and in areas thick with trees and bushes. The Flat-Coated Retriever was recognized by the AKC in 1915.

It is a skilled bird hunter with excellent scenting abilities. The Brittany&rsquo;s pointing and retrieving skills and high level of obedience made it popular among hunters, particularly poachers. Brittanys were first imported to North America in the 1920&rsquo;s and recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1934 (the registered name was changed from &lsquo;Brittany Spaniel&rsquo; to &lsquo;Brittany&rsquo; in 1982, out of recognition of its more &lsquo;setter&rsquo;-like hunting style), but took a while to catch on popularity due to the absence of a long tail. The Brittany has slowly risen in popularity due to its small size, easygoing personality, and excellent hunting skills. It is today the most popular pointer in field trials.',

The club initiated a policy requiring proof of three generations of pure smooth coats for registration. This quickly helped set type and made them a distinct breed from the Schnauzer. The German Pinscher played a role in the development of the Doberman Pinscher and the Miniature Pinscher. The German Pinscher was recognized by the AKC in 2003.

The breed was just gaining notice in the United States when World War I broke out. All things German were shunned and popularity slumped.

Gamers put them in a pit with badgers, timing them on the kill, until the so-called sport was banned in 1966. The dogs were also used as turnspit dogs: Glens were put on a treadmill and would walk for hours, turning a large rotisserie wheel that was used to cook meat over an open flame. This spunky little terrier can still catch vermin and with little training it can still be used to successfully hunt foxes and badgers. The Glen was first presented publicly at an Irish dog show in 1933. It is rare in the USA and was recognized by the AKC in 2004.',

The dogs made their way to Europe; the Great Pyrenees remained in the high mountain regions until the Middle ages, when the breed gradually gained popularity with the French nobility as a guard dog. By the late 17th century, every French noble wanted to own one. Armed with a spiky collar and thick coat, the Great Pyrenees protected vulnerable flocks from such predators as wolves and bear. The Great Pyrenees has proven to be a very versatile breed working as an avalanche rescue dog, as a cart-puller, sled dog, as a pack dog on ski trips, a flock guardian, dog of war, and as a companion and defender of family and property. The AKC officially recognized the Great Pyrenees in 1933.',

                'history' => 'The Irish Setter probably came to its own at the end of the 17th Century. It is not well known outside of Ireland that there are two breeds of Irish Setters, but it is fairly certain that the Red and White Setter is the older of the two, and that the solid red color evolved through judicious selective breeding. When Irish Setters came to the show benches just past the middle of the 19th Century, there was a good deal of confusion about their proper color. By the end of the 19th Century, the Red Setter had virtually eclipsed the Red and White, which became so rare that they were thought to be extinct. During the 1920&rsquo;s, efforts were made to revive the breed. By 1944, the breed had re-established itself well enough to have a club of its own, and today it can be seen in healthy numbers at Irish shows and field trials. The present club, the Irish Red &amp; White Setter Field &amp; Show Society, was formed in 1981 and through its endeavours and direction the breed is now well established nationally and internationally. The Irish Red and White Setter was first recognized by the AKC in 2009.',

The coat consists of an outer coat that stands off from the soft inner coat, with fur shorter on the muzzle and ears as well as the fronts of the forelegs and the hindlegs. A ruff of longer fur is around the dog&#39;s neck. It has a pointed muzzle and small, triangular shape prick ears (ears that stand up.) The tail is long, heavily covered with long fur, and is carried curled over and lying on the dog&#39;s back. The white coat contrasts with the black pads and nails of the feet, the black nose, and the dark eyes. The large oval (akin to a ginkgo seed) eyes are dark and slightly slanted with white eyelashes, and the nose and lips and eye rims are black. The face of the Japanese Spitz is wedge-shaped. They share a common resemblance with the white Pomeranian dog, Samoyed and American Eskimo Dog.</p>  	<p>Active, loyal, and bright, the Japanese Spitz are known for their great courage, affection and devotion making them great watchdogs and ideal companions for older people and small children. Most Japanese Spitz are good watch dogs, despite their relatively small size, and they have a tendency to bark to warn of arriving strangers. The Japanese Spitz is first and foremost a companion dog and thrives on human contact and attention, preferring to be a member of the family. They are known as very loyal dogs. They enjoy being active and love to be in the outdoors. They are intelligent, playful, alert, and obedient, and particularly excellent and loving toward children. Unlike many other dogs, the Japanese Spitz will customarily have his or her tail flipped onto its back. In some cases this is thought to be dominant behaviour, but in the Japanese Spitz case this is normal bearing.</p>  	',

In 1925, two pairs of white Spitz were imported from Canada, and for the next ten years more imports came from Canada, the U.S., Australia and China. The offspring of all these dogs were crossbred to create the breed that was recognized in 1948 as the Japanese Spitz.',

The tail, which is typically curled, completes the distinctive silhouette. The Kangal Dog has a double coat that is moderately short and quite dense.

                'history' => 'The Kangal Dog is an ancient flock-guarding breed, thought to be related to the early mastiff-type dogs depicted in Assyrian art. The breed is named for the Kangal District of Sivas Province in Central Turkey where it probably originated. Although the breed has long been associated with the family of the Aga of Kangal, large landholders and chieftains, the majority are bred by villagers who take great pride in the dogs&rsquo; ability to guard their flocks of sheep and goats from such traditional predators as the wolf, bear, and jackal. The relative isolation of the Sivas-Kangal region has kept the Kangal Dog free of cross-breeding and has resulted in a natural breed of remarkable uniformity in appearance, disposition, and behavior. Despite its regional origin, many Turks consider the Kangal Dog as their national dog. Turkish government and academic institutions operate breeding kennels where Kangal Dogs are bred and pedigrees are carefully maintained. The Kangal Dog has even appeared on a Turkish postage stamp. The Kangal Dog was first reported in European and North American canine literature by David and Judith Nelson, Americans who studied the dogs while resident in Turkey. The Nelsons imported their first Kangal Dog to the United States in 1985. This dog, and subsequent imports, provided the foundation for the Kangal Dog in the United States.',

The Koolie vary from 40 to 60 centimetres (16 to 24 in) in size and are a contrast of coat, colour and body type, although they are merled coat pattern.

While some believe the &#39;German Coolie&#39; to be descended from the &#39;German Tiger&#39;, a European herding dog, there is no genetic or even anecdotal evidence to support this claim. A more plausible theory is that these dogs were used by German immigrants in South Australia who, unable to correctly pronounce &#39;collie&#39;, referred to the dogs as &#39;coolies&#39;.

Jindos also keep their coats extremely clean. Jindos are, by nature, watchful of other dogs and may, on their own territory, react aggressively to intruding dogs.

Balance, outline, intelligence, temperament and movement are of overriding importance. The Labrador Retriever is a breed of moderation, thoroughly sound, and willing and able to do its work. The Labrador Retriever is a dog without exaggeration, so light, weedy dogs; long, low-stationed dogs; and cloddy, lumbering dogs are to be equally penalized. The Labrador Retriever should be evaluated as a working gun dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog&rsquo;s ability to work.</p>  	<p>The Labrador Retriever is an enthusiastic hunter with a good nose and a soft mouth. They excel in all performance activities. Another essential characteristic of the Labrador Retriever is the short, dense, double coat that protects the dog when retrieving from water.

                'history' => 'The ancestor of the Labrador Retriever was the St. John&rsquo;s Retriever, a smaller version of the Newfoundland. These dogs were brought to England, probably on fishing boats. Gamekeepers crossed these Canadian imports with various breeds of gun dogs, always striving to improve the breed&rsquo;s hunting and retrieving instincts. By the middle of the 19th century, the Labrador&rsquo;s characteristic water-resistant coat and otter tail were already apparent. By the late 1880s, the breed was sufficiently distinctive that &ldquo;Labrador Retriever&rdquo; became the generally accepted name of the breed. Originally black in color, the first recorded yellow Labrador appeared in a litter born in 1899. Chocolates were also recorded at about the same time, but never achieved the same level of popularity as the blacks and yellows. Originally bred to retrieve from water, the modern Labrador Retriever has proven to be one of the most versatile breeds, excelling in hunt tests and field trials, in obedience and agility events, and also as service dogs.',

The breed was popular in Germany, Spain, France and Italy in the 1500s and continued throughout the 1800s. Like a lot of breeds, the numbers dwindled after the two world wars. It was named the &quot;rarest breed&quot; in the Guinness Book of World records in the early 1960s. Numbers have risen enough to take that title away from it, however it is still considered rare.

Some McNabs sport random white patches on their bodies and faces. Their eyes are set well apart, almond shaped, and brown, hazel, or copper colored with occasional marble flecked or powder blue eyes. The McNab coat is close, dense and weather resistant. They can have a slick single short coat, a short double coat, or a medium length single coat, but their fur is never long. One of the distinctive features of the McNab is their catlike feet which contribute to their agility.</p>  	<p>The McNabs reputation as an indefatigable &quot;all-weather&quot; dog is also opening up a new avenue of work for the dog: Search and Rescue. Currently McNabs are working as evidence search dogs, cadaver dogs, archaeology dogs, and area search dogs for missing persons. Where many other breeds have to be pulled off the search because the dog is tiring, the only limitation for the McNab is the energy of its handler.</p>  	',
                'history' => 'The McNab was developed by Alexander McNab in the late 19th century after he left his native Scotland and bought a 10,000 acre sheep ranch in the Mendocino region of Northern California. Looking to develop a herding dog that could handle the rough conditions on his ranch, McNab crossed the Scottish Collies he brought with him with the tough dogs of the nomadic Basque sheepherders he met near his ranch. Over time, the McNab dogs proved to be supreme herding dogs which California ranchers came to depend on with confidence. Now the breed is spreading across the United States and Canada with a few McNabs working as stock dogs in Germany and some sporting McNabs as far away as Japan.',

The &lsquo;Bull&rsquo; in &lsquo;Bull Terrier&rsquo; derives from the popular practice of &lsquo;bull-baiting&rsquo;, in which several dogs were matched up against a chained bull. The Bull Terrier was later bred with the Spanish Pointer to increase its size, resulting in a highly successful, powerful, persistent fighter. After dog fighting was abolished, Bull Terriers were bred with the Dalmatian to produce a white colored strain, then again with the Staffordshire Bull Terrier to reintroduce color. Both the white and colored types increased in popularity as pets, and both strains remain today. Famous Bull Terriers include the Target mascot &lsquo;Bullseye&rsquo;, Spuds MacKenzie, who was used in Bud Light commercials (and later discovered to secretly be a female!), and Patsy Ann, a Bull Terrier from Juneau, Alaska famous for unfailingly predicting the impending arrival of ships to port.

The Poodle became a popular pet for the French aristocracy, and in time was officially adopted as the national dog. Poodles were imported to America in the 20th century. They slowly rose in popularity and eventually became the country&rsquo;s most popular dog. The poodle is a group of formal dog breeds, the Standard Poodle, Miniature Poodle and Toy Poodle. The origins of the poodles are still discussed with a dispute over whether the poodle descends from the old French Barbet breed or from Germany as a type of water dog.',

During the years around the turn of the century, both smooth German Pinscher and coarse-haired Schnauzer pups appeared in the same litters. The German Pinscher Schnauzer Club initiated a policy requiring proof of three generations of pure coarse-haired Schnauzer coats for registration. This quickly helped set type and made them a distinct breed from the German Pinscher. These Schnauzers were given the name Standard Schnauzer. Miniature Schnauzers were developed by crossing small Standard Schnauzers with the Affenpinscher and possibly the Poodle. The Schnauzer name derived from the German word &quot;Schnauze,&quot; which means &quot;muzzle.&quot; It was used as a ratter and still retains the ability, but is mostly a companion dog today. Some of the Schnauzer&#39;s talents include: hunting, tracking, ratter, watchdog, competitive obedience and performing tricks.',

On the last weekend of September 1991, a group of men and women met at Robert and Lou Ella Kemmer&#39;s house and formed a new breed club that registered a strain of linebred cur that became known as the Kemmer Stock Mountain Cur. These curs are Mountain Curs that are bred from the above-mentioned lines. The best was bred to the best and then linebred. Kemmer Stock Mountain Curs were first registered with the Kemmer Stock Mountain Cur Breeders&rsquo; Association (KSBA).

NGSDs are active, lively, and alert. They are constantly exploring everything in their environment, using all five senses, including taste. Their incredible structural flexibility allows them to pass their bodies through any opening wide enough to admit their head. Their hunting drive is very intense and may overwhelm any training when prey is detected. They use their acute sense of hearing in addition to sight and scent to locate prey. Although gentle and affectionate with people they know, they can be aloof with strangers. NGSDs can be aggressive toward other dogs, especially of the same sex. Its howl has an eerie yet synchronized quality, which gives the breed its name. The howl can be spurred when the dog is disturbed or excited. One tone blends with the next, sending goose bumps up a listener&#39;s back. Opera singers have expressed a particular interest in this vocally skillful canine. This is a hardy and well-balanced dog.

The dogs were sent to Sir Edward Hallstrom who had set up a native animal study center in Nondugi, and then on to the Taronga Zoo in Sydney, Australia. In 1958, Ellis Troughton examined the two singer specimens from the Taronga Zoo in Sydney. Subsequently, the New Guinea singing dog was classified as a distinct species and was named Canis hallstromi (in honor of Sir Edward Hallstrom). In 2005 it was classified under Canis lupus dingo in Mammal Species of the World.',

            'history' => '&nbsp;The Newfoundland (commonly called &lsquo;Newf&rsquo; or &lsquo;Newfie&rsquo;) originated in Newfoundland, Canada, descending from a mix of indigenous breeds with either Viking dogs or the mastiffs of Portuguese fishermen. The resulting breed, present by the 1600&rsquo;s, was a black dog which loved swimming in cold waters; the black and white &lsquo;Landseer&rsquo; Newfoundland developed a century later. The Newfoundland served as a helpful assistant by pulling heavy fishing nets or other equipment and rescuing sailors who had fallen overboard. Local laws limiting dog ownership to one dog per man kept the Newfoundland&rsquo;s numbers low in its home country, but it was exported to Europe, where its numbers grew as it became a popular show dog. In 1832, a Newfoundland name &lsquo;Hairy Dog&rsquo; and its owners saved 180 Irish immigrants from the wrecked ship &lsquo;Despatch&rsquo;. A Newfoundland also reportedly saved Napoleon Bonaparte when he went overboard during his escape from Elba. Well-known Newfoundlands include &lsquo;Sable Chief&rsquo;, mascot of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment and &lsquo;Nana&rsquo; from &lsquo;Peter Pan&rsquo;. Presidents Rutherford B. Hayes and James Buchanan had pet Newfoundlands. English poet Lord Byron had a pet Newfoundland for whom he wrote &lsquo;Epitaph to a Dog&rsquo;, which begins &lsquo;Near this spot are deposited the remains of one who possessed beauty without vanity, strength without insolence, courage without ferocity, and all the virtues of man, without his vices. This praise, which would be unmeaning flattery if inscribed over human ashes, is but a just tribute to the memory of Boatswain, a dog.&rsquo;',

                'history' => 'The breed originated in Norrbotten, Sweden and Lappland/Kainuuland, Finland, and have been documented as early as the 17th century. Sweden and Finland argue about the true home of the Norrbottenspets, but clearly the dog has spent much time in both countries. The dogs were mainly used as hunting companions. By the end of World War I, the Norbottenspets came close to extinction. Due to the very small number of norrbottens, Sweden closed its studbook in 1948. Although some dogs were preserved, they were in a non-Swedish speaking area and in the far north as a farm dog and companion. Enthusiasts sought out the few remaining dogs and started a successful breeding program between the 1950s and early 1960s. FCI confirmed a new breed standard in 1966 and the official name was confirmed as Norrbottenspets. In 1967 the Swedish Kennel Club accepted the breed for registration and a new standard was written. Finland accepted the standard and began registering dogs in 1973. In Finland these dogs are called Pohjanpystykorva. Immigrant farmers have given the dog an even longer name, Norbottens-skollandehund. There is a great effort in Finland to ensure the health of these fox-like hunting dogs and breeding is highly controlled. Healthy animals, that are only distantly related, are being bred with careful consideration of breeding consultants to create a strong background. Sweden has also had a dramatic impact on the preservation of this breed through strict breeding practices.',

Its coat, which consists of a rough, coarse outer coat combined with a soft wooly slightly oily undercoat, is essential for protecting it from brambles and cold water. It has a fairly large nose and muzzle, allowing ample room for olfactory receptors. Its large feet provide traction over rough and slippery terrain. This is a strong athletic breed that can withstand harsh weather and long strenuous hunts. Its expression is open and amiable, reflecting its temperament. The otterhound is noted for its steadfast pursuit of its quarry despite the roughest of conditions. It has an acute sense of smell and can trail unerringly through running water and over all sorts of terrain.</p>  	<p>As a pack hound, the otterhound is amiable with other dogs. As a hunter, it has an innate urge to follow the trails of mammals. Once on the trail, it is determined, single-minded and nearly impossible to dissuade from its task. Even though the otterhound&#39;s job was not to kill its quarry, it will nonetheless give chase to small animals. The otterhound loves to hunt, sniff, trail and, especially, swim. At home it is boisterous, amiable and easygoing (although stubborn), affectionate with its family, and quite good with children. Because the otterhound was never traditionally kept as a pet, it is not among the most responsive of breeds. However, the otterhound is a low-key dog that can function as a quiet companion.</p>  	',
                'history' => 'The Otterhound&#39;s exact origin is not known, but some believe it originated in France. This rather old breed was developed by crossing the Bloodhound with rough-haired terriers, Harriers, and Griffons. When fishermen realized that otter were preying on the fish supply, they used packs of Otterhounds to hunt the otter, hence where the dog got its name. The Otterhound has a sense of smell so acute that it can smell in the morning an otter that passed through the water the night before. In the 20th century the otter population dropped and since the dogs were no longer in high demand their numbers dropped as well. In 1979 sea otters were added to the protected species list and the Otterhound numbers dropped dangerously low. A group of breeders dedicated themselves to saving the breed. While the breed is still rare it is no longer endangered. They have been successfully used to hunt bear, raccoon and mink. It has a good sense of smell and is ideally suited to drag-hunting or searching.',

That&#39;s why it is also called a &quot;Sindh Mastiff.&quot; They are a Molosser type dog from Pakistan and are largely found in that region.

                'history' => 'The Parson Russell Terrier was formally known as the Jack Russell Terrier in the USA. The breed was named after a clergyman named Rev. John Russell. It was used as a small-game hunting dog particularly for red fox, digging the quarry out of its den in the mid-1800s. On English hunts, the dogs needed to be long-legged enough to keep up with the hounds. The breed used to have a strong emphasis on its working ability, so the standard was very broad, allowing a wide range of accepted body types. When show breeders wanted to make the look of the dogs stricter, they decided to change the name to separate the show types from the working types. Effective April 1, 2003 the name Jack Russell Terrier was changed to Parson Russell Terrier as requested by the Jack Russell Terrier Association of America, which was changed to the Parson Russell Terrier Association of America. Some of the Parson Russell&#39;s talents include: hunting, tracking, agility and performing tricks.',

Originally used as a hunter and guard dog, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi was later trained to herd cattle and sheep. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi was not used as a show dog until the 1920&rsquo;s, and then met with only mild success. It was recognized as a distinct breed from the Cardigan Welsh Corgi in 1934, which led to a gradual increase in popularity. By 2006 the Pembroke Welsh Corgi had become the 22nd most registered breed with the American Kennel Club, far outnumbering the Cardigan variety. Famous Pembroke Welsh Corgis include &lsquo;Ein&rsquo;, the genius dog from anime &lsquo;Cowboy Bebop&rsquo;, and Stephen King&#39;s Pembroke Welsh Corgi &lsquo;Marlowe&rsquo;, who &lsquo;Oy&rsquo; from &lsquo;The Dark Tower&rsquo; series is based on.

            'history' => 'Since ancient times, seafaring from east to west in the Mediterranean region has led to the exchange of culture and science between nations. These reciprocal relations, even though mainly of a commercial nature, also gave the opportunity for an exchange of domestic animals. Amongst these were watch and guard dogs which were needed in harbors and coastal settlements as a protection against pirates and robbers coming in by sea. Amongst these mostly large, strong, resistant dogs with large heads and powerful teeth, one type distinguished itself. It was the mastiff of the Iberian Peninsula, which, in Spain, was used in various areas as a hunting or as a fighting dog against bulls and other dogs. This breed accompanied King Jacob I on his conquests and arrived in the Balearics about the year 1230. In the 17th century, Minorca and others areas came into British possession, following the treaty of Utrecht. The British brought their own fighting and guard dogs with them into the Balearics and crossed them with the native mastiffs of the Iberian Peninsula, which also occurred in the Balearic Isles. In the beginning of the 18th century, fights between dogs and bulls (bull baiting) were very popular and the Britons inhabiting the Island looked for a breed which would be held suited to such fights. These circumstances explain the name &ldquo;Ca de Bou,&rdquo; (Bull Dog). In the Spanish Stud Book for the year 1923, the existence of this breed is already established. The first official entry was in the year 1928 and in 1929, when such a breed was exhibited for the first time at a dog show in Barcelona.',

A mix of Bloodhounds and Curs reportedly comprised the original stock. For the next 200 years the dogs were bred by generations of Plott family members and were referred to as the Plott&#39;s hounds. The dogs worked at hunting bear and raccoon in the Appalachian, Blue Ridge and Great Smoky Mountains of the eastern United States. The Plott family rarely put the dogs on the market so they remained rare outside the southern United States. The dogs were recognized for the first time in 1946 by the United Kennel Club. Plotts are hardy and have superior hunting instincts. They are very effective in the search for coyotes, wolves and wildcats. The breed was carefully developed to be stronger and more persistent. They were able to make good family companions but were seldom kept as such, as most owners acquired the dogs for the hunt. In 2006 the breed was officially recognized by the AKC as the &quot;Plott&quot; and is now shown as a show dog, but there are many who still hunt and breed them as hunting dogs.',

Detailed descriptions are found in 19th century hunting literature: in 1819 Jan Szytier (Poradnik Mysliwych) describes the Polish &quot;brach&quot; and the Polish scent hound; in 1821, in the magazine &quot;Sylwan&quot;, W.Kozlowski gives a description and provides illustrations of both types, the Polish &quot;brach&quot; (heavier) and the Polish scent hound (lighter); the very detailed description of Ignacy Bogatynski (1823&ndash;1825, Nauka Lowiectwa) could be used as the first breed standard. After the first World War, the Polish scent hound was still used for hunting in Poland in the eastern regions, but especially in the mountains on particularly difficult terrains. In the Podkarpacle region, the famous Polish cynologist, Jozef Pawuslewicz (1903&ndash;1979) hunted with Polish scent hounds and was engaged in the development of breeding this dog. He wrote the first Breed Standard and it is on account of his efforts, that the breed was officially registered by the Polish Cynological Association.',

It is also said to have Tibetan Terrier and Lhasa Apso in its blood. As with many breeds, World War II very nearly led to the breed&#39;s extinction and was revived by Polish breeders after the war. Popular in Poland and elsewhere, it is generally kept as a household companion, although it remains an excellent herder. It can also work in obedience, tracking, agility and therapy.

The German variety has probably influenced the modern breed most (&lsquo;Poodle&rsquo; is German for &lsquo;splash&rsquo; or &lsquo;puddle&rsquo;). In 18th and 19th century Europe, the Poodle served a wide variety of purposes, including duck hunting, guiding, and later circus performing, from whence the modern grooming style likely arose. The Poodle became a popular pet for the French aristocracy, and in time was officially adopted as the national dog. Poodles were imported to America in the 20th century. They slowly rose in popularity and eventually became the country&rsquo;s most popular dog. The poodle is a group of formal dog breeds, the Standard Poodle, Miniature Poodle and Toy Poodle. The origins of the poodles are still discussed with a dispute over whether the poodle descends from the old French Barbet breed or from Germany as a type of water dog.',

However, the Podengo could be a descendant of small Iberian wolves. Although the Medio&#39;s closest relative, the Podengo Grande, is now very rare, this lively and alert medium-sized hound remains a popular dog, particularly in rural parts of northern Portugal. It is sometimes still used as a small-game hunter there. Hunting in packs or alone, the Portuguese Hounds became very skilled at hunting rabbits. Human intervention in breeding has reduced the Medio&#39;s size, while leaving other characteristics intact. In Portugal these dogs are used for hunting, ratting, guard work and companionship. It is nicknamed the Portuguese Rabbit Dog. This breed was recognized by the AKC in 2012',

The muzzle is narrow and fox-like, with straight but crowded teeth. Its coat is short with very thin, glossy fur. Coat color is mostly black and tan. The Prazky Krysarik is 2 cm shorter in maximum height than the Miniature Pinscher is in minimum height.</p> 	<p>Best known for its active and lively nature, the Prague Ratter is a spunky breed that is full of original character. These tiny dogs thrive on strong and dependable relationships with humans, love to receive affection and play the role of lap dog during down time. This breed is highly intelligent and generally responds well to basic training and commands. As a pet, the Prague Ratter is obedient, loyal, loving, and very affectionate. The Prague Ratter adapts well to full-time indoor and apartment living, yet still enjoys spending time outdoors, playing games such as fetch, and taking long and leisurely walks. They are also known to be a very quiet dog unlike many other small dogs who tend to be very &quot;yappy&quot;. Like any small dog one should be wary of allowing them to develop Small Dog Syndrome as they can become aggressive if they are not well-socialized from an early age.</p> 	',
            'history' => 'The breed was popular in central European royal palaces in the Middle Ages. It was already an established breed by the time of the rule of the Polish king BolesÅ‚aw II the Generous (1058&ndash;1081). He became fond of the Ratter and had two of them imported from Bohemia. As their name suggests they were also commonly used as rat catchers in rural and urban households. The popularity of the Prague Ratter started decline in the 19th century when the Miniature Pinscher became more fashionable. The breed went through a renaissance in the 1980s as Czechs and Slovaks started to breed them again. It is not yet an FCI acknowledged breed, as there is only about 2500 Prague Ratters registered and they usually only have 1-3 puppies per year. They are nevertheless presented at shows in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.',

The Puli was recognized by the AKC in 1936.',

            'history' => 'The Rat Terrier is an American breed descended from the terriers brought over by English miners and other working class immigrants. These terriers probably included crosses between the Smooth Fox Terrier, the Manchester Terrier and the now extinct white English Terrier. These dogs were used as ratters, and gambling on their prowess in killing rats was a favorite hobby of their owners. Some of these dogs were crossed with Whippets or Italian Greyhounds (for speed) and Beagles (for hunting ability). Eventually, these tough little terriers evolved into today&rsquo;s Rat Terrier. The breed was popularized by President Teddy Roosevelt, who frequently hunted with his Rat Terriers. Many are still used as ratters and squirrel hunters, particularly in the South, where they are sometimes known as &ldquo;Feists&rdquo;. The Rat Terrier was officially recognized by the AKC in 2013.',

The name &lsquo;Redbone Coonhound&rsquo; derives either from its distinctive red coat or from the name of Peter Redbone, an early breeder from Tennessee. Another influential early breeder was George Birdsong of Georgia. Breeders crossed the existing animal with the Red Irish Foxhound for increased speed and scenting. The Redbone Coonhound was then known as the &lsquo;Saddleback&rsquo; for its black back, which was intentionally bred out for a solid red color. The Redbone Coonhound has been categorized in the American Kennel Club&rsquo;s Miscellaneous class since 2001, eligible for full recognition if a sufficient number are registered.

European settlers of Rhodesia in the 1700&rsquo;s found a domesticated dog with such a ridge among the native Khoisan tribe. They adapted the Rhodesian Ridgeback to the purpose of hunting lions and other large game, probably by crossing it with large breeds that came with them such as the Bloodhound, Greyhound, and Great Dane. The resulting breed could run at great speeds, withstand harsh weather conditions, and hunt by sight or scent. Groups of two Rhodesian Ridgebacks were sent out to corner, taunt, and confuse a lion while the hunter stepped in for the kill. The first breed standard for the Rhodesian Ridgeback, based on the Dalmatian, was drawn up in 1924, and American Kennel Club recognition followed in 1955.

They grew in popularity, and were brought to America in the late 1800&rsquo;s to serve as sheepherders. The standard created for the Collie in 1885 remains unchanged today.

Both were brought together under the same Russian Toy Terrier name in 1988 and the &quot;Terrier&quot; was dropped from the name when the breed was added in 2006 to the official list of breeds registered with the F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Cynologique Internationale[1] and has been registered in the Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club since 2008, allowed to compete in AKC companion events since 2010.

However, in the period 1920 &ndash; 1950, shipping of toy terriers was almost stopped and the number of dogs fell to a critical level. Only in the mid-fifties did Russian dog breeders begin the rebirth of the breed. Practically all dogs which were used in breeding had no pedigrees; many of them were not of pure blood. The standard established for the Toy Terrier significantly differed from the English Toy Terrier&#39;s standard in many aspects. From this moment, the evolution of the breed in Russia went its own way. On October 12, 1958, two smooth-haired dogs, one of which had a slightly longer hair, gave life to a male dog with a spectacular fringe on its ears and limbs. The decision was made to keep this characteristic. The male was mated with a female dog which also had a slightly long hair. So the longhaired variant of the toy terrier appeared. It was called Moscow Longhaired Toy Terrier. A dog breeder from Moscow, Yevgueniya Fominichna Zharova played an important role in creation of this breed variant. The long isolated evolution and specific selection process have resulted in the creation of a new breed, the Russian Toy of two types: longhaired and smooth-haired.',

If a Bolonka&#39;s coat gets severely matted, they may develop a hematoma. Bolonka dogs are considered suitable for people with allergies, as they are bred to be hypoallergenic.

It was named after the Arabian city &quot;Saluki&quot; in the Middle East, which no longer exists today. Their bodies were often found mummified alongside the bodies of the Pharaohs themselves, and their pictures appear in ancient Egyptian tombs dating from 2100 BC. The Muslims considered them a sacred gift of Allah, and they were never sold but only offered as gifts of friendship or honor. Salukis with a patch of white in the middle of the forehead are thought by Bedouin tribes to have &quot;the kiss of Allah&quot; and are regarded as special. Incredibly fast even over rough terrain, this desert sight hunter was used by the Arabs to hunt gazelle, the fastest of the antelopes, along with fox, jackal and hare. They have also been successful as racing dogs. The Saluki was recognized by the AKC in 1929.',

The body is slightly longer than the height at the withers, and the front legs account for approximately 55% of the height. The head is large but proportional to the body, with dark eyes. All &Scaron;arplaninac are solid in colour: fawn, iron grey, white or almost black; usually sable or gray with darker &quot;overalls&quot; on the head and back, the undercoat being paler. The colour need not be completely uniform, and most &Scaron;arplaninac have several different shades of the same colour fading into one another. There are no bicolours and no uniformly black-coated dogs among purebreds, but odd-coloured specimens do exist. The dogs must not have large white patches in their coat.</p> 	<p>The temperament of the breed is described as independent, reliable, protective but not snappy, incorruptible and devoted to its master. The breed is aloof with outsiders, and calm until a threat to the flock presents itself. The breed has an extremely protective nature. In the absence of a flock of sheep, the &Scaron;arplaninac will often treat its humans as sheep - herding them away from danger or undesirable areas. They are serene and majestic, gentle with children and smaller dogs. They are also highly intelligent and bred to work without human supervision while guarding the flocks in the high pastures. Young pups can kill small animals until trained not to hunt. Like many of its cousin Mountain dogs, the &Scaron;arplaninac is a very serious and dedicated guard dog. Due to this, they are naturally suspicious of strangers and will need good socializing at a young age to lessen this innate personality trait. They are calm and gentle with their family but when faced with danger they become a formidable foe, not a suitable breed for all. Consistent and firm training is essential to ensure compliance.</p> 	',
            'history' => 'The Sarplaninac (pronounced shar-pla-nee-natz) is an ancient livestock guarding breed from the mountain region of southeastern Yugoslavia, known in Roman times as Illyria. This breed was formerly named the Illyrian Shepherd Dog when first recognized by the FCI in 1939. The name was changed in 1957 to Yugoslavian Shepherd Dog Sharplanina, after the Sharplanina mountain range where the breed is most common. Like all ancient breeds developed in isolated regions, the origin of the Sarplaninac cannot be determined. It is believed to be descended from the ancient Molossian dogs of Greece and the livestock guarding dogs of Turkey. Although little known in the United States, the Sarplaninac is still widely used in its homeland to protect flocks against predators. Until 1970, Sarplaninacs could not be legally exported from Yugoslavia. The first to arrive in the U.S. was actually carried down from the mountains by mule. Since then, growing numbers of American and Canadian ranchers have been successfully using Sarplaninacs for predator control. The Sarplaninac was recognized by the United Kennel Club on January 1, 1995.',

Coursing deer is an old hunting technique that is rarely used today. This technique involved bringing the dog as close to the deer as possible and then releasing the dog to run down its prey. The Scottish Deerhound is a large boned and very fast breed, there were rarely sustained chases when coursing. The chase would typically be over within a few minutes. The Scottish Deerhound is very similar to the Greyhound as well as the Irish Wolfhound. The Scottish Deerhound was a primary contributor to the revival of the Irish Wolfhound in the 19th century. The Scottish Deerhound&#39;s hunting necessity became less and less prominent with the invention of the gun. Hunters required only a tracking dog to find the wounded animal and so the Scottish Deerhound was transitioned to a show breed kept only by breed enthusiasts.',

                'history' => 'The Scottish Terrier originated in the highlands of Scotland. Although references to small, scrappy &ldquo;earth&rdquo; dogs appeared in several of the earliest books on dogs, there are few written records of early breed history. Scotties remained isolated by geography until the late 1870s, when Captain W. W. Mackie toured the highlands, buying Scottish Terriers and writing about them. Predators such as foxes, badgers, rats and other vermin competed with local hunters for scarce game. Scotties were bred to go underground and flush or kill any such creature that went to ground. At first, the breed was surrounded by controversy, with each proponent certain that he alone had the correct breed type. There was even controversy about the breed&rsquo;s correct name. They were sometimes referred to as Aberdeen Terriers, Cairn Terriers, and Skye Terriers, but as their popularity grew, &ldquo;Scottish Terrier&rdquo; was the name that stuck. By the turn of the century, Scotties were appearing in show rings on both sides of the Atlantic. During the 1930s, Scotties were wildly popular. President Franklin Roosevelt&rsquo;s Fala was the most well-known dog of his era. Today, the majority of Scotties are family companions, but the breed&rsquo;s feisty character and instinct to dig and hunt are still intact.',

Touted as the world&rsquo;s rarest dog in Time Magazine and The Guinness Book of World Records, the breed became popular and was saved from the brink of extinction. Today, they are a popular pet with over 70,000 representatives of the breed registered.',

The Shih Tzu was a favored pet of royalty, but fell into decline when British troops raided the Forbidden City in 1860. The breed survived, but was generally not distinguished from the Lhasa Apso until 1934, when the smaller, shorter nosed variety was reassigned its original Chinese name, &lsquo;Shih Tzu&rsquo;. The Shih Tzu was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1969 and has continued to climb in popularity to this day. Crossbreeds between Shih Tzu and other toy breeds are also increasing in popularity, particularly crosses with the Poodle and Bichon Frise.',

The Siberian Husky attracted attention when it completely dominated native breeds in the 400 mile &lsquo;All-Alaska Sweepstakes&rsquo; race from Nome to Candle in 1910, the second year in which it competed. It gained further prominence in 1925 when a gold miner named Leonhard Seppala used a now-famous team of Siberian Huskies to make an urgent delivery of diphtheria serum to Nome, saving thousands of lives. This delivery became known as the &lsquo;Great Race of Mercy&rsquo; and attracted much attention to the Siberian Husky. A statue honoring Seppala&rsquo;s team stands today in Central Park. In 1930, Russia allowed the last group of Siberian Huskies to be exported from Siberia; the breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club that same year. Most Siberian Huskies today descend from the 1930 exports and Leonhard Seppala&rsquo;s team. Today the Siberian Husky is one of the most popular northern breeds, serving as a pet, sled racing dog, and show dog.',

The ship had Maltese dogs onboard that survived and mated with the local terriers, resulting in the Skye Terrier breed. The dogs were used to hunt down vermin, fox and badger that would prey on the farmer&#39;s livestock. In the 19th century Queen Victoria took a liking to the breed and the Skye Terrier became very popular for a while, especially among the nobility. A Skye named &quot;Greyfriar&rsquo;s Bobby&quot; was said to have guarded the grave of Constable John Grey, who was his master, for 14 years. Townspeople came and fed him until he died at age 16. A statue was placed in Edinburgh in the dog&#39;s honor. The Skye was first exhibited in England in 1864. The AKC recognized the breed in 1887.',

It was used by farmers who needed dogs to help get rid of the animals that would prey on the farmers stock, such as fox and rats and other small vermin. The Fox Terrier would find the animal in the ground, relentlessly digging, barking, growling and lunging until it harassed the animal out of its den where the hunter could then kill it. The Fox Terrier came in both a smooth coat and a wirehaired coat and both were considered the same breed for many years. The Wirehaired Fox Terrier was bred by crossing in the rough coated Black and Tan Terrier, for use in rough country, its coat being less vulnerable to damage than that of the Smooth Fox Terrier. The first standard for the Smooth Fox Terrier was established in 1876, separating it from the wirehaired dogs. However, they are still considered the same breed with different coat varieties by some clubs, but have been separated in the United States since 1984. Both the Smooth Fox Terrier and the Wirehaired Fox Terrier were recognized by the AKC in 1885. Some of the Fox Terrier&#39;s talents include: hunting, tracking, watchdog, agility and performing tricks.',

Galgos are higher in the rear than in the front, and have flatter muscling than a Greyhound, which is characteristic of endurance runners. They also tend to be smaller, lighter in build, have longer tails and have a very long, streamlined head that gives the impression of larger ears. Their chests are not as deep as a Greyhound&#39;s and should not reach the point of the elbow. Unlike Greyhounds, Galgos come in two coat types: smooth and rough. The rough coat can provide extra protection from skin injuries while running in the field. They come in a variety of colors and coat patterns. Main colors are &quot;barcino&quot; or &quot;atigrado&quot; (brindle), &quot;negro&quot; (black), &quot;barquillo&quot;(golden), &quot;tostado&quot;(toasted), &quot;canela&quot; (cinnamon), &quot;amarillo&quot;(yellow), &quot;rojo&quot;(red), &quot;blanco&quot; (white), &quot;berrendo&quot; (white with patches) or &quot;p&iacute;o&quot; (any colour with white muzzle and forehead).</p>  	<p>Galgos have a very similar nature to Greyhounds. They are calm, quiet, gentle and laid back; happy to sleep their day away on their backs on a sofa. More than 90% of Galgos can be considered cat-friendly and are therefore an ideal choice for the hound lover who also owns cats. Almost all Galgos are also friendly towards other dogs and small dogs. Galgos are also very good with children, being calm in the house so there is less risk of a child being knocked over or jumped on than with a more excitable breed. They are very gentle and tolerate the often over-enthusiastic attentions of children with little risk of retaliation from the dog. Galgos have a very reserved personality and they have a tendency towards shyness, so it is very important that they be socialized early in life so that they grow up to be comfortable around strange people, dogs and locations.</p>  	',

The first Saint Bernards were of the shorthaired variety, as the longhaired variety&#39;s coat tended to collect icicles. They were used by the Hospice, a refuge for travelers through the dangerous Alpine pass between Switzerland and Italy. In the middle of the seventeenth century, the Saint Bernard became popular as a rescue dog working to save people from avalanches in the snowy passes near the Hospice. The dogs are able to smell a person under many feet of snow. They have saved thousands of people searching out and finding lost or injured travelers. The dogs would work in packs looking for the victims. When found they would lick and lie down with them in order to keep them warm. While a dog or more would lie with the body(s), another dog would head back to the Hospice to alert them that they found the humans. A full rescue team would then be sent out. The Saint Bernard has also been known to be able to predict storms and avalanches. This may be possible because of the dog&#39;s ability to hear very low-frequency sounds which humans cannot. The Saint Bernard was recognized by the AKC in 1885. Some of the Saint Bernard&#39;s talents are search and rescue, guard dog, watchdog and carting.',

                'history' => 'The Sussex Spaniel is a fairly rare breed. It was developed in the 1800s in Sussex, England. It is a small-game hunter and companion dog. The breed was probably developed from crosses of spaniels with hounds. The dogs were used as field hunting dogs. Their slow pace along with their fine nose, good strength and stamina made them popular for hunters on foot flushing and retrieving upland game. The breed&rsquo;s numbers plummeted during World War II. An English breeder by the name of Joy Freer is credited for saving the breed. Joy owned eight of these dogs which she saved and fed during the war. Most of today&#39;s Sussex Spaniels are direct descendants from her dogs. The Sussex Spaniel was recognized by the AKC in 1884. It was one of the original nine breeds recognized by the AKC. Some of the Sussex Spaniel&#39;s talents include: tracking, hunting, retrieving and watchdog. It is the only spaniel to bay while hunting.',

In 2009, the Tamaskan Dog Register introduced a Saarloos Wolfdog as a single out-cross to bring some fresh blood into the breed.

These accounts mention the natural strength and physical and mental impressiveness, which is evident in the Tibetan Mastiff today. Even its deep bark has been described as a unique and highly treasured feature of the breed. Many cynologists consider the Tibetan Mastiff the forefather of all large mountain and mastiff breeds.

The Tibetan Spaniel is considered an ancient breed, being that there is evidence of its existence over 2000 years ago. Most small Asian dogs are believed to be descended from the Tibbie. Highly esteemed in ancient Tibet, they were often given as gifts to royal houses and the dogs were spread throughout Asia. Depictions of the dogs were found on early Eastern art dating back as far as 1100 BC. The dogs worked turning the prayer wheel for their masters and also as watchdogs in Tibetan monasteries. They would sit up on the high walls and bark at anything they believed didn&#39;t belong. The breed was first introduced to England in the late 1800s. It was recognized by the AKC in 1983.',

The dwarf size Bulldog puppies were and still are occasionally born out of regular size parents, but they were neither the healthiest, nor the most fertile dogs. They often produced regular-size puppies. Thus, this version of the breed had never been established. Another attempt of creating the Toy Bulldog was via crossbreeding French Bulldogs, English Bulldog, and their offspring to decrease the weight to desirable 20 pounds or so. There were several dogs, and the breed was presented by &ldquo;The French Toy Bulldog Club of England&rdquo; to the Kennel Club. However, this version of the breed had not been developed to the point of recognition as well. English breeders and Kennel Club representatives refused to call a mixed breed dog a Bulldog.',

The breed was revived beginning in 1968. The short legged variety of the breed disappeared, but there are a significant number of the long legged dogs now in Hungary and Romania.

Walker and George Washington Maupin, are given credit for the breed&#39;s initial development. The dogs they bred were referred to as Walker Hounds, and were used to hunt raccoons. In the 1800s, a stolen black and tan dog named Tennessee Lead was crossed into the Walker Hound. Tennessee Lead was of unknown origin, but he greatly influenced the Walker. The Walker Coonhound, Treeing, was first recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) in 1905 as a part of the English Coonhound breed, at the request of breeders. The name was later changed to Treeing Walker Coonhound, and it was fully recognized as a separate breed in 1945. It was recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in January 2012, making it the AKC&#39;s 174th recognized breed.',

It was used by the Magyar tribe of the Carpathian Basin for rat hunting as far back as 800 A.D, and later adapted for pointing, retrieving, and tracking. The first written record of the Vizsla appears in the &lsquo;Illustrated Vienna&rsquo; chronicle, prepared on order of King Louis the Great in 1357. Vizslas faced near extinction in the 1800&rsquo;s, falling in popularity to the English pointer. The Vizsla is an ancestor of the Weimaraner and German Shorthaired Pointer, and these breeds may have been later crossed back into the Vizsla. The rare Wirehaired Vizsla (only a few hundred exist in North America) was developed by crossing the Vizsla with the German Wirehaired Pointer and Griffon in the 1930&rsquo;s for a dog with heavier coat for hunting in cold weather. A Vizsla named Sari was the first Vizsla imported to the United States, in 1950. The Vizsla was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1960 and is today a popular show dog, hunter, and pet.',

The Clumber Spaniel, the Sussex Spaniel, the Welsh Springer, the Field and the Irish Water all developed from the English Springer / Cocker in Wales, probably before 1300 AD. At one time all of these dogs were considered &quot;Cockers&quot; or &quot;Cocking Spaniels&quot; and were interbred. Hunters started to divide the dogs into categories of Land Spaniels and Water Spaniels and the Welsh Springer was labeled as a Land Spaniel. The Welsh Springer Spaniel was given the name &quot;Welsh Cocker.&quot; In the late 1800s the Welsh was separated into a different breed from the English Springer. The Welsh Springer was bred to find and spring at the game. Hardy, it was able to work in all types of weather and terrain, had great stamina on the hunt and could work for hours without resting. The Welsh Springer has a tendency to wander too far from the hunt field, and therefore it is necessary to give it constant training&mdash;beginning at about six months of age. The jolly disposition of the Welsh Springer makes him a fine companion and family dog. Some of the Welsh Springer&#39;s talents include: gun dog, tracking, hunting, retrieving and watchdog.',

Coat colour may be solid black or brown, or black with white, or brown with white, with or without white ticking or roan marks. The texture of the coat should not be woolly, as such fur will not resist water. The ears are low set and hang flat to the head, and the tail curls tightly over the back.

The breed standard describes the breed&#39;s temperament as reserved and &quot;an ideal guard-dog&quot;. though never aggressive, which makes it an excellent family-dog. Although described as &quot;strong willed&quot; the Wetterhoun is never stubborn or wilfully disobedient. Perseverance is a much better term, because they finish what they started, whatever it takes. Imperturbable they finish what they think to be their task. Thereby the breed is sensitive and should never be treated or trained harshly.

Hunters began to develop a longer-legged terrier, predominantly white in color so as not to be mistaken for a fox. Early fox terriers were primarily smooth-coated, but the wire coat persisted. By the end of the 19th century, smooth and wire-coated Fox Terriers were in great demand, both as companions and show dogs. Although considered one breed for many years, interbreeding of Smooth Fox Terriers and Wire Fox Terriers ceased in the early 1900s. Except for coat, however, the two breeds are essentially identical. Both the Smooth Fox Terrier and the Wirehaired Fox Terrier were recognized by the AKC in 1885.

An enthusiastic hunter, his goal was to breed a dog that would hunt in all kinds of terrain. Korthals mixed German Griffons, French and German Pointers, Spaniels, Barbets and a Setter. He developed the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon in his breeding program in less than 20 years, writing a standard, and in 1916 formed the Griffon Club of America. The dogs excel in small-game hunting, such as hare and quail; they are eager hunters with fine noses. That same year he showed sixteen Wirehaired Pointing Griffons at the Westminister Kennel Club Dog Show in New York. In the 1980s a select few breeders decided to mix the Cesky Fousek into the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon lines. This caused an uproar and the American Wirehaired Pointing Griffon Association was formed with the goal of preserving the purity of the original breed. The American Wirehaired Pointing Griffon Association is the AKC parent club for the WPG. The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon was recognized by the AKC in 1887.',

One of these thicker coated females was crossed with a German Wirehaired Pointer. The breeder who did this was Mr. Vasas Jozsef. He tried two such matings with the same male and different females. The Wirehaired Vizsla has two cousins, the Smooth Vizsla and the other, a rare longhaired Vizsla. The longhaired can be born in both smooth and wire litters, although this is quite a rare occurrence. The longhaired Vizslas are not registered anywhere in the world but there are some to be found in Europe. The Wirehaired Vizsla was officially recognized by the AKC in 2014.',

With the defeat of the Aztecs and their culture by the Spanish, the breed diminished drastically, essentially becoming rare. It is thought the breed was saved from extinction by its adoption by remote, mountain-dwelling Indians. Never entirely forgotten, interest in the breed was eventually revived and it was formally recognized by the FCM (Mexican Kennel Club) in 1956.

However, it seems likely that Scotsmen seeking work in the woolen mills of Yorkshire brought with them various types of terrier, including the Skye Terrier, Dandie Dinmont, Manchester Terrier, Maltese and the now-extinct Clydesdale (Paisley Terrier). These were then crossed with local types, such as the longhaired Leeds Terrier. At first, the Yorkie was a much bigger animal than the one we see today, but by selectively breeding the smallest individuals, the dog was gradually miniaturized over the years. It was made into a fashion dog. Women carried these little dogs in their bags and under their arms. The Yorkshire Terrier was first recognized by the AKC in 1885.',

This is a mellow, quiet breed that has a melodious voice when it chooses to use it. The enormous, expressive, brilliant-blue eyes of this breed give it an unusually contemplative countenance. Himmys do not do well left unattended for long periods of time, as they crave human contact and companionship. The Himalayan can be playful, but spends most of its time supervising its people and making sure all in the household is in order. This lap cat forms very close bonds with its owners.</p>',

This feline breed has a long body stature along with green or yellowish-green eyes, pointed ears, triangular-shaped pointed head and a soft, fine, silky coat.</p><p>Nebelung cats are lively, playful, affectionate, good-natured, and intelligent. The cat&#39;s mild-mannered state and personality may not always reflect the relatively high level of intelligence often found in the breed. In spite of the fact that it is an active cat, it can live very well indoors. Nebelungs prefer their own families and often keep a distance from strangers. They tend to bond with a select few humans and stay loving and devoted throughout their lives. It is, however, a cat that gladly accepts company of its people or of another cat. Nebelungs are very good communicators and will remind their owners of problems. This happens often since Nebelungs can be very picky about things such as litter cleanliness and food type. Many owners of the Nebelung cats say that they can act more like dogs at times, being extremely loyal to their owner and family. It enjoys sitting in a lap and being petted and will follow its favorite person devotedly from room to room. This is a cat that likes routine and may require a little time to adjust to changes in the household. Early socialization can help it become more adaptable.</p>',

This is a medium to large-sized, muscular, brawny cat that was intentionally bred to closely resemble the wild Coastal Red Bobcat found in the mountains of the Pacific Northwest. The breed has a stocky athletic build, large bone structure and long, heavy legs. Its hind legs are a bit longer than its front legs. This, together with its big paws and long toes, give the Pixiebob a rolling gait similar to that of true wild felines.</p><p>Pixiebobs are outgoing, friendly cats with an almost dog-like devotion to their human family members. They crave companionship, affection and attention. They are intelligent, respectful, playful animals that usually can be left unattended during a normal workday, although they probably would enjoy the friendship of another household pet. However, owners of the Pixiebob must be prepared to lavish plenty of attention on their pets once they walk through the door after a long workday. This breed is bright enough and willing enough to be taught to walk on a halter and leash so that it can participate in family outings and activities. Imagine the look on the neighbors&rsquo; faces when they see someone walking a &ldquo;bobcat&rdquo; on a leash. Seriously, despite their exotic appearance, this breed is all about loving and anything but wild.</p>',

They enjoy the company of humans and being given attention, and are compatible with children and other pets. Snowshoes are very social and docile, and show great devotion and love towards their owners. Consequently, the breed dislike being left alone for long periods of time and are able to cope with working hours more if they have another cat companion. Snowshoes may express themselves and their complaints vocally, though their meows are not as loud as the Siamese. The cats are also noted as being intelligent; they can learn to open various types of doors, and can be taught tricks, especially fetch. Snowshoes also enjoy water, particularly running water, and may on occasion swim. Though very active, they are not restless or easily agitated, and they have a fondness for perching in high places.</p>',

Although, as a breed, these felines are rare, they are extensively common in their home island of Cyclades in the Aegean Sea. Although the local people have welcomed them inside their households, the feral population of these cats is also large. They are found openly roaming around, or resting on a boundary wall or under the tree shed, or lurking around fishing boats. They are medium-sized cats with semi-long hair and a lean but muscular structure and a thick tail. The almond-shaped eyes of these cats are green. Since this cat has not been recognized by any cat registries, the probability to find it bred as a pet in an American household is less.</p><p>Aegean Cats tend to be smart and lively, with good communication skills. They are generally friendly toward people and can be excellent cats for families with children. True to their heritage as island cats, Aegeans don&rsquo;t disdain water and may even go fishing for themselves. Consider this cat if you&rsquo;ve always wanted a feline fishing buddy. If you have an aquarium or koi pond, however, you might want to make sure its denizens are protected from a curious cat with a grasping paw. The Aegean Cat usually likes being part of the family and is well suited to most types of homes. He&rsquo;ll appreciate having an enclosed outdoor area where he can climb or lie out in the sun, but he shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to roam.</p>',

The breed originated in North America. This breed is considered distinct from the Asian Semi-longhair breed, the British variant. The Chantilly was thought extinct until the 1960s when two of these cats appeared during an estate sale.</p><p>Chantilly cats are characterized by moderateness. They are neither too gentle or lazy, nor too active. This is one trait that has mostly appealed to the cat fanciers and owners. However, the CT kittens are very playful and mischievous. These cats are good with children and all other pets. They would also take part in games and activities with their family members. Being a human-oriented breed, they would follow their favorite family members from room to room and vocally interact with them in a low mewling voice. However, they are reserved when they have strangers around. Chantillies love playing with toys and would steal those play items that they find exciting. They are affectionate and do not enjoy being alone, or if ignored.</p>',

            'overview' => '<p>Chausies are bred to be medium to large in size, as compared to traditional domestic breeds. Most Chausies are a little smaller than a male Maine Coon, for example, but larger than a Siamese. Adult Chausie males typically weigh 9 to 15 pounds. Adult females are usually 7 to 10 pounds. However, because Chausies are built for running and jumping, they tend to be built like basketball players. They are long-bodied and leggy. They often appear quite large, but they weigh less than one would expect. The TICA Chausie breed standard allows three colors: solid black, black grizzled tabby, and black (a.k.a. brown) ticked tabby. Because the Chausie breed is relatively new, Chausies are still frequently born that have a variety of other colors and patterns, and they make wonderful pets. However, only the three permissible colors are considered ideal. Only cats in the three permissible colors can be entered in new breed classes at cat shows, and only the three colors will be eligible eventually for championship classes.</p><p>Although a descendant of a wild cat, the Chausies are very active, interactive and assertive by nature. They love people and their company. They are known to be excellent jumpers and for their hunting skills. They need your time and attention, especially for some interactive play sessions. They would jump, run and leap into the air while playing. They need cat toys to play with and a separate area dedicatedly for their adventure moments. The fearless character of this breed tends to land them into trouble if these cats are allowed to go outside. These curious felines would learn to open doors and go out, often ending in some mischief. But they are intelligent and alert, and would easily pick up commands from their owners. These cats are ready to please their owners, and are similar to dogs in loyalty. They are mostly one-man cats, and would prefer to spend every moment with his most-loved person in the household. Although, they are affectionate with other members as well.</p>',

            'overview' => '<p>The Bengal is a domestic cat breed developed to look like exotic jungle cats such as leopards, ocelots, margays and clouded leopards. Bengal cats were developed by the selective breeding of domestic cats crossed then backcrossed and backcrossed once more with hybrids from the Asian leopard cat (ALC), Prionailurus bengalensis bengalensis, and domestic cat, with the goal of creating a confident, healthy, and friendly cat with a highly contrasted and vividly marked coat. Bengal cats are typically larger than the average house cat. Males on average weigh between 10-15 lbs (4.5 &ndash; 6.8 kg) and females 8&ndash;12 lbs (3.6 &ndash; 5.4 kg). The International Cat Association recognizes several Bengal colours (brown, seal lynx point, mink, sepia, silver) and patterns (spotted and marbled) for competition and shows. In the New Traits class, other colours may be shown, as well as longhairs.</p><p>Its fierce appearance is a complete contrast to its docile, gentle and sociable behavior. These intelligent, curious cats have a striking resemblance to dogs in terms of their traits. The Cheetoh is an excellent lap cat, loving to be in the company of human beings throughout the day. Being trustworthy, sociable, amicable and affectionate, they are well suited for children, dogs, and other cats. The male cats are not at all hostile, displaying maternal affection towards the kittens as well as the juvenile cats. They have inherited this trait from the Ocicat. They are so fond of playing that they even go to the extent of waking up their owners in the morning to get started. These attention-seeking cats do not like to be on their own so give them company always or bring in another pet in your household to keep it entertained.</p>',
